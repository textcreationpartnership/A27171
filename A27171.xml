            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Before <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Paternity</hi> were added to your Honourable Titles, you was intitled to this book: your Dignities being dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb facs="tcp:103707:4"/> by you. I conſidered not their eminency, but the eminency of your Vertue and Piety. I know, My Lord, that you aim at a better reward than this World can give; but that a great light ſet on a high place cannot be hid from the eyes of Men, Angels alone ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the brightneſs of yours: you ſhun praiſe as much as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: you neither deſire nor want any thing of Fame. But, My Lord, I wanted a living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a ſincere and devout lover of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S to exemplifie my Diſcourſe: and though (God be praiſed) many more might be found in this Church, yet you are one of the faireſt and moſt attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: inſomuch that though it be eaſier to write than to do well, yet a better Pattern of a Religious
<pb facs="tcp:103707:4"/> Life might be drawn from your actions than from my directions.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have juſt cauſe to fear that I have indulged my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius too far, and perhaps ſome will think that I would have God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be <hi>Shorn,</hi> and Devotion a <hi>Recluſe</hi> from the World, which is far from my thoughts or deſires: though I muſt confeſs that at firſt I intended a much different and leſs defective Treatiſe on this ſo good a ſubject had not other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary helps as well as abilities been wanting. However at the beſt I could have added nothing to ſuch perſons as your Lordſhip. The Holy flames of Divine Love that burn in your heart have too much light and fervency to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any increaſe from me: and therefore I have not aimed at any

But, My Lord; though I cannot in the leaſt profit you by this my poor labour, yet its being own'd by you may be very advantagious to me. Your Reverend and much Honoured name will not only cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and recommend my Book, but alſo promote its deſign of winning affectionate Servants and Lovers to JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>'TIs probable that they, who theſe many years, have cried out <hi>Popery</hi> (till they made way for it to come) upon every thing they liked or underſtood not, will ſtart and think that their fears are come upon them, at the ſight of the firſt Title-page: and poſſibly our Lay-Abbots will alſo be frighted at it, as though the diſpoſſeſt <hi>Coenobites</hi> were coming again to lay claim to their old Manſions and fat Indowments. For my part I wiſh that theirs may be but pannick terrors: yet withal, I wiſh they might ſo far affect them, as to make the firſt have a greater value for that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> and purer worſhip which then they would certainly loſe;
<pb facs="tcp:103707:6"/> and the laſt pay Tithes <hi>Conſcienciouſly</hi> out of thoſe eſtates, which then they would be forced to reſign. And yet I may, and do aſſure them, that if they will read not only the Title, but the Book alſo, it will certainly cure them of their fears, if it works no better change upon them: for its deſign is not to alter the eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to make us more devout and ſincere in the profeſſion thereof; nor yet to inrich any perſons with temporal eſtates, but to make us <hi>gather treaſures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and <hi>ſet our affections on things above.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the age we live in, is greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, is no obſervation of mine; there are almoſt as many that complain of it, as there are that contribute to the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of its wickedneſs. 'Tis in every mans mouth that vertue being diſgraced, vice is countenanced, and that the numerouſneſs of its votaries, makes it now impudent, as well as faſhionable. Therefore it ſhould be no difficult matter, to perſwade thoſe that have any ſence of Religion, or longing
<pb facs="tcp:103707:6"/> after its rewards, that they ought not <hi>to conform themſelves to this preſent evil world,</hi> but chuſe a better pattern to live by. And the truth is, it matters not much, whether theſe be worſe than the former times; for the way to life hath all along been <hi>ſtreight and narrow,</hi> and found and followed but by <hi>few:</hi> as that to deſtruction <hi>wide</hi> and ſpacious, and yet crouded by the <hi>many.</hi> Good men have always lived in a <hi>perverſe and crooked generation:</hi> So that if it be now, as it hath ever been, thoſe that will enter into life, muſt follow the <hi>narrow</hi> path, though they have but few fellow-travellers: and if it be worſe, they muſt walk with the greater care and warineſs. However it be, the difference muſt needs be very great, betwixt the lives and works of thoſe, whoſe reward and condition will be ſo vaſtly different at laſt. And therefore whoever will go to heaven, had need keep at a great diſtance from that <hi>world which lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> and take a much contrary courſe, to thoſe <hi>many</hi> who go to deſtruction.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:103707:7"/>
                  <p>But how then? Muſt we retire into <hi>Thebais,</hi> with the Fathers of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert? Muſt we confine our ſelves to the ſolitude of a <hi>Monaſtick Cell?</hi> Or ſhall we become Quakers, and profeſs the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs of Melancholy Fanaticks? Why, truly in Popiſh Countries, the Cloiſter hath ingroſſed the name of Religion, and they that would be, or be thought to be devout beyond others, do uſually put on a Fryers hood, and imbrace the Rule of ſome <hi>Religious Order:</hi> and amongſt us Puritaniſm hath uſurped the Name of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> and ſome who, in truth or in pretence, abhor looſeneſs, or are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from a vicious life, will too often forſake not the World, but the Church; as it were to preſerve the ſtrictneſs of a ſeverer vertue, in the Society of a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Brother hood, 'Tis not to be doubted but that long before S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and even from the beginning, there hath been <hi>Civitas dei, &amp; Civitas mundi, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light,</hi> and <hi>children of this world:</hi> or to uſe the modern diſtinctions
<pb facs="tcp:103707:7"/> 
                     <hi>the Godly,</hi> and <hi>the Wicked, Regular</hi> and <hi>Secular</hi> perſons. Not becauſe ſome have made new vows, wore diſtinct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, or choſen new guides, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church: but becauſe ſome <hi>have lived after the fleſh;</hi> ſome <hi>after the Spirit;</hi> that is, ſome have followed Gods revealed will, ſome onely their own, ſome have obeyed the precepts of Chriſt, and too many their own luſts and humors. However I would not make any exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt either <hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> by diſobliging truths: rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what is praiſe worthy in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would have, and 'tis every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans duty, to be really devout, mortified and preciſe, without entring the Cloiſter or the Conventicle.</p>
                  <p>For indeed I am ſomewhat jealous, and not without reaſon, that the ingaging men to be Religious and Vertuous, by other conſiderations beſides their Chriſtian duty, hath done ſome prejudice to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; becauſe now there be ſome that fanſie ſelf-denial and contempt of the
<pb facs="tcp:103707:8"/> world to belong only to Friers, and others, that to abſtain from ſwearing and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, is only the part of a Puritan: Whereas Chriſtianity binds thoſe duties on all its Profeſſors, and every one, by his Baptiſmal vow is bound to perform them; though he doth not ſubmit himſelf to the Rule of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or the dictates of the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, they are all parts of our duty. Whatever is good in it ſelf, or any ways a means to make us good, is commanded or recommended in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is contained in the Chriſtian Rule: wherefore I ſay the Chriſtian Profeſſor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to attain higher degrees of holineſs, the higheſt pitch of Chriſtian perfection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life, needs not ſeparate
<pb facs="tcp:103707:8"/> from the Church, nor make new vows nor wear diſtinct habits: but only mind ſeriouſly, and ſincerely diſcharge the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which he lies under, in being a Diſciple, and a Servant of the Holy JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</p>
                  <p>My deſign therefore is not to Incloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,<note place="margin">Vellem univerſos Chriſtianos ita vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ut qui nunc ſoli Religioſi vocantur, parum Religioſi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derentur.</note> but to make a large Monaſtery of the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, at leaſt to make every family a School of Vertue and Piety, and every man an <hi>Aſcetick</hi> and ſtrict liver: wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heartily with <hi>Eraſmus</hi> that they, who hitherto, have been called <hi>Preciſe</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> by way of appropriation, might juſtly loſe that name, by the more exemplary lives of all other Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But though it be my wiſh, it is not my hope in the leaſt, to ſee any ſuch thing come to paſs, by means of this little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. Many much bigger and better have not been able to effect it. They that will
<pb facs="tcp:103707:9"/> not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, nay, Chriſt the Lord himſelf, will be far enough from being perſwaded by the meaneſt of his ſervants: And where the Text it ſelf is not regarded, no Comment can ſignifie much. I mean that if the Holy Religion we own, be not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our lives; if the Goſpel which is here preached and profeſſed in purity, doth not make us holy, 'tis in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any other inſtruments ſhould prevail. But yet our indeavours ought not to be wanting; it may not be in vain to diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie Chriſtian inſtructions; ſeverall ways of perſwaſion may affect ſeveral perſons: and perhaps that which to day is ſlighted, will to morrow make a deep impreſſion. However it is more or leſs the duty of every one of us, with great S. <hi>Paul</hi> to trie all means that <hi>by any means we may ſave ſome:</hi> at leaſt that we may ſave our ſelves; that if thoſe arguments which we think moſt forcible cannot convince others, they may may at leaſt move us to take the better heed, <hi>that after we have
<pb facs="tcp:103707:9"/> preached to others, we our ſelves be not caſt-aways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to this end (having obſerved how much in all caſes, men will do and ſuffer for love) I have thought nothing would more conduce, than to make a Chriſtian love God with a ſincere and devout affection: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout love being undoubtedly not only the beſt part, but alſo the beſt inſtrument of true Religion; an irreconcilable enemy to ſin; a friend, or rather a nurſe to all holy vertues.</p>
                  <p>No enticement could have drawn peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Magdalen</hi> to any of her former ſins, whileſt in the fervency of her love, ſhe waſhed her Saviours feet with her tears: and 'tis known by experience that when reading, meditation, the ſight of a dying friend, or any ſuch thing, hath ſoftened a mans heart into a religious temper, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations will be then ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, that they durſt not ſo much as appear before him. But when he returns to mind earthly things, and hath his thoughts taken up again with the concerns of this preſent life, he finds that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb facs="tcp:103707:10"/> ſtrength decays, by the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions that his love becomes cold, and he grows indevout again.</p>
                  <p>Love is the Queen, if not the fountain of paſſions, the great mover and governor of actions and affections: could we keep the fire of Divine Love always burning in our breaſts, it would be the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beſt inſtrument of Holy-living; it would make ſelf-denial and the yoke of Chriſt eaſie, it would make acts of vertue and Religion pleaſant; and it would make us delight in pleaſing God, as much as we naturally do in pleaſing our ſelves. Therefore I have made it my aim and deſign in the following Pages, to ſeize upon the affections: to inkindle in the hearts of Chriſtians the heavenly flames of the love of God. To that end, I have repreſented the more general benefits of God to mankind, and eſpecially that of Redemption, by the greateſt demonſtration of love that ever was given, the death of the Bleſſed JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S: which, if duly conſidered, would be an irreſiſtible motive
<pb facs="tcp:103707:10"/> to love him. I have ſhewed the power, the pleaſure, and the great advantages of love; and I have uſed devout medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ejaculations, as it were to tranſport our ſouls to heaven by love, for to adore that God, whom love brought down from thence to ſave us. 'Tis certain that moſt of them that periſh, periſh for want of conſideration; and I have heard dying men wonder at themſelves, how they could be ſo ſtupid, as not to mind thoſe things which are of an infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and ſhould rather take up all our thoughts and our cares, than be neglected or forgot one only moment. <hi>Iſrael doth not underſtand, my people doth not ſider,</hi> Iſa. <hi>1.3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Love may be ſaid to be that fire which God would have always to burn upon his Altar, <hi>Lev. 6.12.</hi> that is, in our hearts, which are his Temple, where the ſacrifices of good works and the incenſe of devotion ſhould always be offered to him: now that ſacred fire muſt have fewel to entertain it; it muſt be nouriſhed by reading good books,
<pb facs="tcp:103707:11"/> and eſpecially by frequent and pious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Wherefore I have endeavoured as much as I could to feed thoſe holy flames, by repreſenting things as they are; and I would have every Chriſtian, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and often to conſider, what God is, what he hath done, what he doth, and what he will do for us, if we love him ſincerely: as alſo, what we are, whence we come, whither we go, and how eaſie it is for us to be eternally happy, if we will ſet our affections upon God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them ſo infinitely. Doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration is the cauſe why God is not loved! It is not poſſible men could reſiſt the charms of his love, if they would open the eys of their mind and of their faith to view them!</p>
                  <p>But how few is there that mind atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively their obligations to love God? how few that ſeriouſly ponder how much it is their duty and their intereſt to love him heartily, who is infinitely lovely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and infinitely good to us? or rather, how fully is the propheſie fulfilled, <hi>Iniquity
<pb facs="tcp:103707:11"/> ſhall abound and the love of many ſhall wax cold,</hi> Mat. <hi>24.12.</hi> To how many Chriſtians might our Bleſſed Saviour now ſay, as once to the Jews, <hi>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you,</hi> John <hi>5.42.</hi> How juſtly might now S. <hi>Paul</hi> complain, <hi>all men ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s, Phil. <hi>2.21.</hi> And how juſtly might our Bleſſed Lord, the great lover of men, complain in the words of his Apoſtle, <hi>I will gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you;</hi> (or rather, I have gladly ſpent, and been ſpent for you) <hi>though the more abundantly I love you, the leſs I be loved, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>12.15.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This want of Divine Charity, is a very ſad and general evil amongſt us Chriſtians, in theſe worſt of times: and I have obſerved, that even amongſt them that hope for heaven, the major part go no farther in their love, than only to deſire pardon and ſalvation, without ſeeking to make any returns ſuitable to thoſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and incomprehenſible mercies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:103707:12"/> ſo much ſtupidity and ingratitude, I have oppoſed the following Treatiſe of Divine Love, or <hi>the Love of JESUS,</hi> which I hope will help to reinkindle or at leaſt ſtir up the holy fire in ſome Chriſtian ſouls, by the argument it ſelf, if by no other means. Whileſt my Reader fixeth his mind on this moſt excellent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſubject, his own thoughts will improve my conſiderations, and many better may be ſuggeſted to him. And if any ways, I can occaſion his ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and the glory of my Bleſſed Lord, I have attained my aim. And now have no more to ſay by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but that if I have been ſo unhappy as to write any thing contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church; I diſown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it before hand, and would blot it out with my blood: as for particular perſons, who may find fault with any thing herein, I deſire them to paſs it by. It matters not much, if they like not every paſſage and expreſſion; if they do but follow what they judge to be good, and
<pb facs="tcp:103707:12"/> approve my deſign, and love Jeſus with all their hearts; it will be enough for their profit and my ſatisfaction.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>IT is God that hath made us and not we our ſelves,</hi> we owe him our very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>thine hands have made and faſhioned me:</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet imperfect, and in thy book were all my members written.</hi> Pſal. 119.73. Let us ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the ſame Prophet, <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:</hi> Pſal. 134.16. and let us with him, <hi>fall down and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> You know that by the Laws of God and of all Nations, there is an indiſpenſable obligation upon all children to love and honour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents becauſe they brought them into the world: now certainly the obligation doubles upon every man, in reſpect to his <hi>Father which is in heaven;</hi> for our natural parents
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103707:14"/> were but ſecond cauſes under him, his own power it was that form'd and created us: they engendred our mortal bodies only, he is <hi>the Father of ſpirits,</hi> he himſelf gave being to our immortal ſouls. Therefore let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man pay to his Maker thoſe duties he would expect from his child: <hi>If I am a Father</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>where is mine honour?</hi> Mal. 1.6. If from our heavenly Father we have received our life and being, let us pay that reſpect, and love and obedience to him, which thereby are become his due.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet more in this; Creation is not a tranſient act; the ſame power that once gave us our being, doth ſtill exert it ſelf in the continuation thereof. When a child is born, he ſubſiſts by himſelf, his parents need not take aay care, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns not to his priſtine condition: but we have the ſame dependance upon God in our preſervation as we had in our creation; ſhould he withdraw his Almighty hand, we ſhould return to our firſt nothing; <hi>in him we live and move, and have our being;</hi> Therefore we are the more bound to ſerve and love him, that he not only made us to be; but gives us, as it were, a new being every moment, by continuing our life and durati n by that Almighty will, whereby he effected our firſt production</p>
                     <p>Now if we conſider further, not onely that God made us, but what he made us, it will yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103707:15"/> inforce thoſe bonds of duty, which Creation tied upon us. For it was in our Makers power, either to make us vile and abject as the vileſt of beaſts, or to deny us thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and abilities, which are moſt honourable and moſt uſeful to our nature: but he made us Men, the moſt wonderful of his creatures? in us he joyned what heaven and earth had moſt excellent, an immortal Spirit, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after his image, with the moſt elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the moſt perfect of material things: Take a view of the marvellous organs of thy ſenſes, of the curious contrivance of thoſe joints and ligaments which unite thy ſeveral members, of thoſe various and delicate channels which contain thy blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; in a word of all the parts and paſſions of thy body, which are all made for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and comelineſs; and then admire the great goodneſs, as well as wiſdom of thy Creator; and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, that thou art <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> and that Gods works <hi>are very marvellous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this let thy thoughts dive deeper and conſider thine interior ſenſes; the myſterious union of thy ſoul and body, with the beauty of that Divine Light which we call Reaſon; thy memory, thy will thine underſtanding, which are the facul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of thy precious ſoul, which is not only created after Gods image; but is capable and deſirous to enjoy him: and then ſee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103707:15"/> how numerous, or rather innumerable are the benefits which God hath beſtowed upon us in our creation, and how juſt it is that we ſhould love him, that <hi>we ſhould glorifie God, in our Body and in our Spirits, which are Gods.</hi>

                     <p>PReſervation comes next to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a benefit of very large extent, and well deſerving that rank, the Church hath placed it in, in making it the ſubject of our daily thankſgiving; for ever ſince man changed the impenetrable armour of Original Righteouſneſs, for a thin covering of fig-leaves, he became ſo defenſleſs, and yet expoſed to ſo many ſharp and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrows, that ſhould not Divine Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction interpoſe for to ſhelter and ſecure him, his temporal Life would be a true and a ſad Emblem of Eternal Death. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the hiſtory of patient <hi>Job,</hi> that if we were not fenced about with the hedge of a gracious providence, we ſhould find that all creatures conſpire our vexation and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103707:16"/> ruine. God had no ſooner broke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure; but afflictions crowded in ſo faſt upon that happy man, that in a ſhort time there remained nothing of his former proſperity, but a bare and bitter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, to make the ſenſe of his preſent miſery more grievous. There is no man but is expoſed to all the greateſt Calamities that ever befel any of the Sons of <hi>Adam:</hi> and there is none able by his own power, to defend himſelf againſt the leaſt of them. Fortune and accidents ſport themſelves (if I may ſo ſpeak) with our goods and eſtates; Moths fret our garments, ruſt cankers our mettals, thieves break through and ſteal our riches or elſe <hi>they make to themſelves wings and fly away.</hi> Beſides their own corruptibility which of it ſelf would conſume them, they are expoſed to ſo many hazards, that it would be as impertinent, as 'tis impoſſible to number all the ways and means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are afflicted with loſſes, and brought to poverty: only from hence we may juſtly infer, that the ſame God <hi>who gives us all things richly to enjoy,</hi> muſt alſ ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them in our poſſeſſion, or elſe we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe them.</p>
                     <p>If we look on our ſelves, we ſhall like the Prophets man in <hi>Dothan,</hi> 2 Kings 6. ſee armed enemies on all ſides of us; our ſpiritual enemies are many, ſtrong, and full of rage and malice; and yet we have no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103707:16"/> defence againſt them: but that God makes his heavenly hoſt, to wait on our ſafety, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps his Angels about us, to be an inviſible guard againſt our inviſible enemies, and not only ſo, but to ſecure us alſo from thouſands of ſudden and ſad accidents, which might every moment befall us. All creatures are now furniſhed with a ſting wherewith they may either vex or kill us. The elements and all compounded bodies, the air we breath, and the food that nouriſheth us, all things in nature, and all things in chance, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our tormentors or murtherers. Nay, we carry ſwords and daggers in our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms; we have within our ſelves the matter of all ſorts of diſtempers; not one joint in our bodies but may be afflicted with the gout; Not one humour, but may overflow its banks, and quench the light of Reaſon, or the fire of Life; Not one pore or part within or without, but may unexpectedly, at all times, and in all places, become an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to death and ſorrow. In the midſt of ſo many and great dangers, it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to ſtand one moment, but that <hi>God defends us under his wings</hi> and <hi>keeps us ſafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feathers,</hi> Pſal. 90. as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, and ſo the bleſſings of immunity, which moſt men ſlight, or overlook, are never enough to be acknowledg'd, but deſerve the thanks of a whole life. <hi>We dwell under the defence of the moſt high, and abide under the

                     <p>THe Poſitive Bleſſings of this life, are now to be expoſed to view; but of them, I may uſe the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>If I would reckon and ſpeak of them, they are more in number than can be numbred,</hi> Pſal. 40. Health and ſtrength, and comlineſs, with induſtry and learning, are ſhared among the ſons of men in ſeveral proportions: and ſo are good friends and a good name, peace, plenty and pleaſures; any one of thoſe ſingle, might make a rich portion for one man, for each, within it ſelf contains many rich and precious bleſſings: yet oftentimes, God unites all, or moſt of theſe together, <hi>to crown us with loving kindneſs and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> Pſal. 103. The works of creation, and the works of providence are not more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, than the graces and gifts of God to mankind; any one that ſhould ſeriouſly meditate upon this ſubject, would find it multiply and increaſe almoſt to immenſity,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103707:17"/> and would be forced to break off with the exclamation of <hi>David; Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of many that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> Pſal. 8.4. God renews his mercies to us every day together with our lives; every hour, <hi>we eat of the fatneſs of his houſe, drink of the river of his pleaſure,</hi> Pſal. 36. and receive the ſweet emanations that flow continually from <hi>the fountain of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of thoſe benefits which God pours open hands upon us, how many are there that paſs unregarded! we uſually mind, not what we receive, but what we deſire. Let hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven rain Manna never ſo thick upon us, if we wiſh for Quails, Angels food ſhall be unſavory, and perhaps diſtaſtful. They that long for great and well covered tables, find no reliſh in their daily bread; they that purſue after wealth, look not on the bleſſings of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency; they that aſpire to honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive health, food and raiment, rather with a diſdainful anger, than with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; all the favours we receive from God, are unobſerved or ſlighted as long as he doth not gratifie our humour with what we deſire, and even thoſe gifts whereof we are moſt ſenſible, are ſoon laid in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion; an hours pain will cauſe many longer pleaſures to be forgotten; and if God ſends evil upon us only for one day, it makes us forget the many good things,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103707:18"/> which we for many years received from him. This I ſay, becauſe many mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiableneſs and ingratitude makes them overlook moſt of Gods bleſſings; deſpiſe what they have, and value only what they have not; and ſo murmur and complain when they ſhould give thanks. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall diligently obſerve all the gracious diſtributions of that God, who always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to all men, being debtor to none; all the ſupplies and comforts we receive from him, will heartily ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints;</hi> and, <hi>O that men would therefore praiſe the Lord, for his goodneſs, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men; that they would exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praiſe him in the ſeat of the elders,</hi> Pſal. 31.107.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103707:18"/> of his paſture;</hi> we are, and we have nothing that is good, but it comes from him; he made us, he preſerves us, and he provides for us: therefore, <hi>O go your way into his gates with thanſgiving and into his courts with praiſe, be thankful unto him, and ſpeak good of his name.</hi> It was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s vow, that if God would keep him, and give him food and raiment, whilſt he ſojourned in <hi>Haran, then the Lord ſhould be his God:</hi> Now what was his vow ſhould be our reſolution and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; God feeds, and cloaths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends us, therefore ought he to be our God; That is, we ought to own him for ſuch by faithful ſervice and hearty obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Therefore, 1. Let us pay our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Benefactor, the juſt and eaſie tribute of Praiſe and Thanſgiving, for our creation, preſervation, and all the bleſſings of this life. 2. Let us ſet apart daily, ſome of that time which he gives us, for acts of Worſhip and Religion. 3. <hi>Let us honour the Lord with our ſubſtance;</hi> either in ſecret charities or publick offerings, paying him an acknowledgment, that he is our Land-lord; and laſtly, let us apply our ſelves to obſerve his Laws, to do what pleaſeth him; becauſe we are not our own, we owe our ſelves to him, we are his, he gave us our being. Theſe are acts of natural Religion, and them we owe to God, as he is our Creator and Benefactor.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the mercies of Redemption, and firſt, a conſideration of the infinite miſeries we were redeemed from.</head>
                     <p>NOw are to be conſidered the benefits we receive from God as we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the mercies of our Redemption; how God our Creator is become <hi>JESUS,</hi> our Saviour; how after having given us many good things, he at laſt gave himſelf for us. And that we may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the greatneſs of this unſpeakable and Divine Mercy, let our meditation deſcend a while into that bottomleſs gulf of perdition, wherein we were plunged by nature, in this plain manner. Repreſent to thy ſelf a man in <hi>Job</hi>'s condition, having added to his ulcers and poverty all the ſaddeſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that ever afflicted any man upon earth, eſpecially the remorſes and horrors of a guilty and tormented conſcience, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of impatience and deſpair with <hi>Cain, my pain is greater than I can bear.</hi> This unhappy creature having for many years born the uneaſie weight of his miſeries,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103707:19"/> linger'd out a tedious and diſconſolate life, is at laſt ſtruck to the heart with a mortal wound and dies, and ſo paſſeth from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral to eternal ſorrows; he falls into a lake of fire and brimſtone, a place where there is nothing but woe and darkneſs, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth; where there is no company but of tormented and tormentors; nothing to be ſeen but what is frightful, no voices to be heard but curſes, ſhrieks and lamentations, where there is the abſence of all good, and the preſence of all evil; where <hi>men deſire to die,</hi> and <hi>death flees away from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the fulneſs of his miſery, that it ſhall have no end, that he muſt dwell with everlaſting burnings; <hi>their fire is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their worm dies not.</hi> If weeping but one tear every day, he might expect to be releaſt, after he had wept as much as would make an ocean, it would be ſome comfort! but at the end of ſo many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of years as would ſuffice to weep a Sea, his torments will be as far from ending as the firſt day they began: and if after this manner in proceſs of time, he ſhould ſhed tears enough to make many more ſeas, yet ſtill it might be truly ſaid, <hi>this is but the beginning of ſorrows;</hi> ſtill there is an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Eternity to come; for after as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of millions of years as tongue can expreſs or heart comprehend; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103707:20"/> is nothing leſſened; ſtill it is what it was before, an abyſs of duration that can have no end; this excludes all comfort, this fills his ſoul with a woful deſpair, this is another hell in the midſt of hell, which inrageth him, and perpetually tortures his mind, to think that there will be no end of his ſufferings, that he can conceive no hope of being delivered: but that he muſt bear to all Eternity, what every moment is intolerable! O dreadful eternity, who can ſeriouſly think of thee and not tremble!</p>
                     <p>Now if thou doſt ask for what reaſon this wretched creature is thus tormented, know that it is for ſin; becauſe his firſt parents broke the Law of their Creation, and he followed their footſteps; they involved him firſt in the guilt of a wicked rebellion againſt God, and afterwards by his own acts he made himſelf yet more criminal; by nature he was a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> and then he became ſo, yet more by his own tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; he was <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> and then he became a willing ſlave to it; his own thoughts, words and works being evil, and that continually, he forſook God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured him, and profeſt enmity againſt him, and oppoſed his depraved will to Gods Holy Will, and ſo became obnoxious to the infinite juſtice of God, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly inflicts this deſerved puniſhment upon him.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103707:20"/>
                     <p>And now, if knowing the reaſon, thou doſt inquire after the perſon, who by being ſo unholy, is become ſo extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; I could ſay with the Prophet, <hi>thou art the man,</hi> this is thy patrimony, as thou art a child of <hi>Adam;</hi> this thou art by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the divine mercy hath reſcued thee from this miſery, and therefore I muſt ſay, <hi>thou wert the man,</hi> this muſt have been thy caſe, had not the Holy <hi>JESUS</hi> workt thy Redemption by means as wonderful, as was his pity and charity.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed, I muſt alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one queſtion. Two men are equally indebted, and equally unable to pay; the one is patiently forborn and at laſt freely acquitted, the other is caſt into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and a while after compaſſionately releaſt and ſet at liberty; I demand, is not he that never entred the priſon, as much bound to love his generous creditor, as he that was delivered out of it? yes, doubtleſs, or rather more: becauſe his debt is alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and yet he is freed from that trouble and ſorrow, which his fellow debtor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went. Why then, thy gracious Redeemer, by ſaving thee from the horrors and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, hath laid on thee, at leaſt as great obligations to love him, as if he had brought thee out of it, after thou hadſt been long detained therein. Therefore I deſire, thou wouldſt bring thy thoughts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103707:21"/> back again to that unpleaſant abode, and conſider thy ſelf as if thou were ſhut up in that diſmal dungeon, and then expreſs what thou wouldſt give to be releaſt, what thou wouldſt do for him that ſhould bring thee out of that horrible and bottomleſs pit.</p>
                     <p>I know that they that are afflicted with ſharp pains and grievous ſickneſſes, would purchaſe health with all the wealth they have; and I believe no reward would hire a man to hold his hand in the fire but for one hours time: therefore I doubt not but that, if it were in a mans power, he would give this, and a thouſand more worlds, to be brought out of an ever burning furnace: and I am perſwaded, that if thou wilt ſuffer thy fancy to be active in framing the black and dreadful ſcene of helliſh horrors about thee, thou wilt then heartily ſay: Were I owner of the whole univerſe, I would joyfully give it, to come out of theſe ever-burning flames which torment my body, and to be freed from this never dying worm, the remorſes of my guilty conſcience, which torture my ſoul: but becauſe I have nothing, freely would I give my ſelf to him, that ſhould bring me out of this woful place. O I would follow him any where, do any thing that he ſhould command me, imbrace his feet, kiſs the ground they tread on, and give him all the demonſtrations of a ſincere and paſſionate Love!</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103707:21"/>
                     <p>Well, thy petition is granted, before 'twas preſented; the Love and Mercy of <hi>JESUS</hi> hath prevented thy requeſt, and diſtreſs: Now make good thy vows and reſolutions; Love and Serve <hi>JESUS</hi> thy Redeemer, and give thy ſelf up wholly to him. I know that many may be good Chriſtians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>being ſnatcht out of the fire,</hi> without theſe terrors and affrightments: but I am ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what our condition had been without a Saviour, what is that gulf of perdition, whence <hi>JESUS</hi> hath ſaved us, if we will be ſaved by him: and I mention theſe <hi>affrighting truths to perſwade men;</hi> to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of an active and a vehement Love. For 'tis too obſervable, that few men ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider what <hi>Redemption means,</hi> what it was we were redeemed from, elſe they could not be ſo indevout, ſo diſobedient, ſo unthankful to their Saviour. <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, as I do here, that without Chriſt we were already dead and periſht, makes it the reaſon of that <hi>Conſtraining Love</hi> which enabled him and other Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to ſuffer ſo patiently, and act ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for <hi>JESUS; The love of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, we were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dead, irrecoverably loſt, had not Chriſt died, to purchaſe life and ſalvation for us: therefore we cannot chuſe but love
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103707:22"/> him, and it is no wonder if that love be ſtrong, and if we are governed and acted by it. That thou maiſt therefore love af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately and live religiouſly, conſider ſeriouſly that death, the miſery of that condition wherein thou wert, and ever muſt have been, hadſt thou not a <hi>JESUS,</hi> a merciful Saviour and Redeemer. I might add, that we were delivered from the power and ſlavery, as well as from the condemnation of ſin: but this is included in the other, it being impoſſible <hi>to be ſaved from the wrath to come,</hi> without <hi>bringing forth fruits meet for repentance:</hi> and as it is mercy and grace on Gods part, ſo on ours, it is matter of duty and earneſt indeavour, and muſt be the reſult and effect of our love, firſt that we offend not, and then that we ſerve diligently, and faithfully him that <hi>redeemed us from our vain converſation, and gave himſelf for us, that we being dead unto ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs.</hi>

                     <p>A Further ingagement to love and obey will be to conſider the manner how our redemption was effected, and the price that was paid for it, thus. The Bleſſed Son of God, the Second Perſon of the Ever glorious Trinity undertook that work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which none elſe could perform: <hi>for us men, and for our ſalvation, he came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and was made man.</hi> In this act of his, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and mercies ſeem to vie one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">In praeſepe jacet, ſed mundum continet, ubera ſugit, ſed angelos paſcit. <hi>Aug. Ser. de purific. 2.</hi>
                        </note> that the God of eternity ſhould be born in time, that the Creator of all things ſhould be the Son of a Creature; that the moſt higheſt ſhould abaſe himſelf to the low condition of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; that God ſhould become an infant, is a miracle of Love, which we can admire and adore, but never fully comprehend.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103707:23"/> The greatneſs of God is unſearchable, his excellencies and perfections are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, he is infinitely good, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, wiſe, and holy: Man contrariwiſe, is in himſelf wicked and weak, ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and miſerable, there is ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion betwixt God and man, ſo wide, ſo immenſe a diſtance,<note place="margin">Haec eſt menſura amoris, non ſolum quantum fecit nos, quanta fecit pro nobis, ſed &amp; quantillus factus eſt pro nobis.</note> that nothing leſs than an infinite love could have filled up the gulf betwixt thoſe two ſo different natures, and united them into one perſon. 'Twas never ſeen that a ſhepherd would creep upon all four, and cover himſelf with a ſheep skin, to call his flock out of danger, and to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it: but <hi>the good ſhepherd</hi> did much more! When he came <hi>to lay down his life for his</hi> loſt and wandering <hi>ſheep,</hi> and gather them into his fold; he took on him, not only the likeneſs, but the very nature of them: he became <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> that he might be the ſhepherd of mankind. Though he was infinitely more above man, then men are above beaſts, yet he became <hi>the Son of man,</hi> that he might become the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of men. 'Twas never ſeen that a Sovereign Prince would ſeek to reduce to loyalty the moſt abject of his rebellious ſubjects, by mixing blooud with them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103707:23"/> uniting their families together: but behold the Supreme Monarch of heaven and earth contracts a near affinity with his ungrateful rebels, who are as vile and miſerable, as they are criminal, that he may free them from their guilt, and win them to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their happineſs. Proud and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner! thou wouldſt be ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the kindred of meaner perſons, thoſe that are much thine inferiors, that thou canſt hardly endure to be in their company: and behold, the moſt Glorious and Holy God, thine offended Sovereign, is become thy near relation, is become thy Brother, that he may win thine affections and become thy Saviour.</p>
                     <p>His life, all along, was a continuation of his great mercy and humility, <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> healing all manner of diſeaſes Corporal and Spiritual, giving excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and great examples of vertue. But what we now conſider, and what ſhould moſt affect us, is, that for our ſakes <hi>he was a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief,</hi> all the time of his abode here below. At his firſt entrance into the world, he was degraded, even below the condition of the meaneſt infants, being born in a Stable and laid in a Manger; eight days after he began <hi>to be numhred among the tranſgreſſors,</hi> receiving the bloody and painful Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumciſion, which belonged
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103707:24"/> only to ſinners; in his youth he lived in poverty and obſcurity, and was ſubject to his Parents; when he manifeſted himſelf to the world, then he perpetually <hi>endured the contradiction of ſinners;</hi> beſides that he lived upon alms, <hi>becoming poor for us, who was Lord of all:</hi> he wanted even time to eat what the charity of pious perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him, and had not ſo much as <hi>a place where he might reſt his head.</hi> He was tempted of Satan, <hi>that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted,</hi> he often watcht whole nights to Prayer, and was often faint with tireſome journeys, and hunger, and thirſt: and what is yet worſe, he was daily perſecuted by ingrateful men, for whom he endured all this. They ſlandered him with falſe imputations of being a glutton and a wine-bibber; his kind and charitable affability in converſing with noted ſinners, was made matter of accuſation, as if he had conſented to their evil deeds; his Divine Doctrine was derided, as if proceeding from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the miracles which he wrought in their behalf, were ſaid to be done by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and packt with <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> and to all theſe diſgraces and contumelies, they would often have added violence, and ſtoned him to death, had he not eſcaped out of their hands by a haſty flight.</p>
                     <p>Lord, thou hadſt compaſſion on the multitudes, becauſe they had followed <hi>thee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103707:24"/> three days, and had nothing to eat,</hi> Mat. 15.32. and thou livedſt above three and thirty years, waiting upon thy baſe and fugitive ſervants, who were become thine enemies, ſeeking to prevent their ruine, by the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of thy care and kindneſs! O ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, that we ſhould be ſo ſoon weary in ſerving thee, when thou wert ſo patient and indefatigable in acting and ſuffering for us, for our happineſs and our ſalvation.</p>

That the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, would become our Brother,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103707:25"/> by becoming Man, and would live in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Contempt, was very much: but that afterwards he would die for us, in that manner as he did, is the greateſt wonder that ever the world ſaw. And indeed, there hapned more prodigies when he died, than than at all other times of his humiliation; the Sun hid himſelf, darkneſs overſpread the whole world; the earth ſhook, the ſtones and rocks were rent, the graves were opened, and the vail of the Temple was divided in twain; Nature ſeemed to be amazed to ſee her God ſuffer and die upon a Croſs: <hi>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend,</hi> 'tis true man cannot poſſibly domore: I, but <hi>JESUS</hi> did much more, he was God, then he became man that he might die for his enemies. This is it, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſaith that it was never conceived or ſeen, how great are the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; <hi>We ſpeak</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wiſdome of God in a myſtery even the hidden wiſdom which none of the Prince of this world knew, for had they known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory: but as it is written, eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither is it entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit.</hi> It appears that he ſpeaks (not of the bliſs of heaven, but) of the crucifixion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103707:25"/> of our Bleſſed Saviour, which to the Jews was a ſtumbling block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs, and which neither the ſenſes nor the reaſon of man could ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; but, as a hidden myſtery was made known to Chriſtians, by the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the all-knowing Spirit of God. To underſtand therefore as much as may be, this never fully underſtood and never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough admired love of our Redeemer, in dying for us, let us in the firſt place view the Breadth of his Croſs; that is, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the torments he endured for us, in the laſt ſtage of his uneaſie pilgrimage.</p>

                     <p>WE may begin with the manner of his apprehenſion; he was taken as if he had been a publick enemy to mankind a thief or a murtherer, with ſwords and ſtaves, with rudeneſs and violence; he was betrayed by one of his Diſciples, forſaken by the reſt, and then bound and dragg'd, from place to place by thoſe he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103707:26"/> and fed, and in whoſe behalf he had wrought miracles. He was called an impious blaſphemer, and voted guilty of death, for confeſſing a great and neceſſary truth, that he was the only Son of God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was expoſed a whole night to the indignities and mockeries of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting enemies; they ſpet upon his ſweet and glorious face; they vailed him, and ſmote his head and buffeted him; and as if he had been a contemptible ideot, to be made ſport withal, they bad him prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, gheſs who gave him the blows. He was accuſed before the <hi>Roman Pretor,</hi> as being a lewd malefactor, a rebellious traitor who <hi>ſubverted the people, and forbad to pay tribute to</hi> Caeſar. From thence he was ſent to King <hi>Herod,</hi> where he was ſet at nought, and abuſed by him and his Souldiers, and then ſent back with ſcorn and contempt to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Barrabbas</hi> a ſeditious mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer was preferred to him, and a loud clamor raiſed by the people, that he might be crucified and put to death. Then was he whipt before their eyes, tied to a poſt like a vile ſlave, and expoſed to the ſervile rods, whiles they <hi>plough'd furrows upon his back,</hi> as the Prophet ſpake; the Souldiers took him, platted a Crown of thorns and preſt it on his head, till the blood run of all ſides of him; they beat him with canes and clubs, and put a reed inſtead of a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103707:26"/> in his hand, and when he was all over ſpittle and blood they brought out their mock-King, and <hi>Pilate</hi> preſented him to the people, and ſaid, <hi>behold the man,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to move them to pity, by ſo ſad a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle; but nothing leſs than his death would ſatisfie their enraged cruelty: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was condemned, and then abuſed afreſh by the Souldiers, and loaded with his Croſs and driven out of the City to Mount <hi>Golgotha.</hi> Now here begins a new ſcene of ſorrows; the afflicted <hi>Son of Man,</hi> having loſt much blood, and ſuffered ſo much; having been rudely haled from the garden to <hi>Annas,</hi> from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate</hi> again, and from thence to the place of his Execution, arrives at laſt, faint and weary, and ſorrowful upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where he was to die; here his hands and feet (which are moſt ſenſible parts of our bodies, by being moſt full of nerves) were pierced through and nailed to the Croſs; and though there was a ſeat where to reſt his body, as the Ancients ſay, yet the Croſs being lift up, and put into the hollowneſs of the ground to make it ſtand upright, his wounded body was ſhaken and affected, doubtleſs with a moſt acute pain. He was expoſed naked, not only to the view of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, but alſo to the open air, which was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103707:27"/> extremely cold, in that the Sun was hid; he was burnt inwardly with an exceſſive heat and drineſs, being tired with ſo many journeys, and being exhauſted of ſpirits and moiſture, by his ſorrows and bleeding, inſomuch that he complained of this above all his other ſufferings, crying out, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> (though we may ſay, that he thirſted moſt our happineſs, that he thirſted to drink out the dregs of his bitter cup, that we might drink <hi>the cup of Salvation.</hi>) He wanted the uſe of his hands and feet, being tied to ſuffer, ſo that he could not ſo much as ſtir, nor wipe the blood off of his face, he was afflicted with the ſight of his afflicted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who from her wounded ſoul reflected ſorrow upon her dying Son and Saviour. His ſoul was alſo, as it were crucified, by the ſenſe of the Divine Anger againſt the ſins of men, for the which he was making expiation, inſomuch that he complained, that God had forſaken him. And laſtly, his heart-ſtrings were broke, and his body deprived of life, by a moſt violent and bitter death. And now, who ſhall not love <hi>JESUS?</hi> and who ſhall not admire that love which is expreſt in the breadth of the Croſs?

                     <p>WE are now to meaſure the length of the Croſs, that is, the time of Chriſts bitter paſſion, the tedious duration of his ſufferings, which began with his birth and continued to his laſt breath. The Life of <hi>JESUS,</hi> as we have ſeen, was, as it were, a chain of miſeries, every link, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connection, had ſomething grievous and afflictive, <hi>he was a man of ſorrows:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we no where read that ever he laught or injoyed the pleaſures and the mirth of this world: but that he ſuffered much and wept ſeveral times, is recorded by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts. Every day was, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the day of his Crucifixion (which to us is <hi>Good,</hi> but to him was ſad <hi>Friday:</hi>) for he knowing all along what he was to ſuffer, and living in expectation of that cruel
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103707:28"/> death: we may ſay that his fears did, in ſome manner, prevent his murtherers, and by anticipation, acted upon him, while he lived, what they were to inflict on him to put him to death: for he was pleaſed to aſſume, together with our nature, our innocent paſſions and infirmities. <hi>I have a Baptiſm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be Baptized with, and how am I conſtrained until it be accompliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> that was the Baptiſm of his Blood, which he wiſht for, becauſe of his love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, his great deſire of paying our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms: but feared, becauſe of the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his humane nature, to ſuch bitter ſufferings; wherefore (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">

But that which we moſt properly call his Paſſion, becauſe it exceeded the reſt of his ſufferings, laſted eighteen hours, without intermiſſion, nine of <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, and nine of <hi>Friday;</hi> from the time of his agony in the garden, about nine at night, while three in the afternoon of the day following; all which time he ſuffered thoſe ſeveral ſorts of pains and tortures, which are already mentioned; all that time, he drank full draughts of that bitter cup, the fear whereof made him ſweat drops of blood, when he began to taſte of it; all that time he ſuffered what no tongue can expreſs, but what all hearts ſhould endeavor
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103707:28"/> to feel and to think of daily. Lord <hi>JESU,</hi> thou wert tormented a long time, that we might not be tormented to all Eternity; grant that we may endure any thing for thee, and from thee our God, who didſt endure ſo much for men, and from men.</p>

                     <p>WE have ſeen that bar of the Croſs, on which the hands of our Bleſſed Saviour were nailed, <hi>the breadth</hi> and <hi>the length,</hi> that is, the variety and the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pains and ſufferings, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went for us: Now we are to conſider the biggeſt piece which ſtood upright, whereon his body reſted and his feet were nailed; <hi>the depth and the height,</hi> that is, the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the greatneſs of his ſorrows. If we read with attention the paſſion of Chriſt in the four Goſpels, we ſhall ſee our Bleſſed Redeemer, as it were, ſunk into a deep abyſs of miſery, by the heavy burthen of our ſins; he might well cry by his Prophet, <hi>See whether there is any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow?</hi> for the greateſt of humane afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons admit of many comforts, whereas he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103707:29"/> was deprived of all; as there was no part in us but was infected with ſin, there was none in him but was affected with pain; he was all over ſtripes and ſores, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal wound within and without, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all his capacities, in his outward and inward ſenſes, in all the parts and faculties of his ſoul and body: the very circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his paſſion, did all concur to make it more bitter and afflictive. He was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that ordinary comfort of being aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his friends, all the Diſciples forſook him and fled; as the Prophet had foretold of him, <hi>I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me; I looked and there was none to help, I wondred that there was none to uphold,</hi> Iſa. 63. He was like a mild and defenceleſs lamb in the midſt of ravenous wolves, there were none about him, but ſuch as thirſted for his blood. And no wonder if man forſook him, when he was in ſome manner forſaken even by his Father. It pleaſed God to give him up to the cruelties of wicked men and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of death; and that his Divine Nature, (though perſonally and inſeparably united to his humanity) ſhould for a time ſuſpend the effects of its beatifying union, and leave him, ſuffer as a man in ſoul and body, the greateſt pains, without the leaſt comforts. They that ſaw our crucified Saviour ſuffer ſo patiently, as not to open his mouth to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103707:29"/> complain, might have thought that he had no ſenſe of pain: therefore he cries out ſo bitterly, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Why doſt thou ſuffer me to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into this gulf of ſorrow, ſo that I have nothing but anguiſh within and without?

                     <p>NOw we have only the height of the Croſs to look on, that is, the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the greatneſs of the torments of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103707:30"/> Chriſts crucifixion; that in this ſenſe his Croſs was very high, appears already by what hath been ſaid; and yet we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further; that he being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt of a moſt pure Virgin, was therefore of a moſt healthful conſtitution; ſo that his ſenſes being very quick and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, were ſenſible of pain beyond other men's: and ſo all the blows and wounds he received, and his being nailed and ſtretched three long hours on the Croſs, as upon the Rack, muſt needs have been a moſt exquiſite torture. Alſo, the vigor of his nature being neither weakned nor ſpent, by age or diſtempers, he being full of ſtrength and in the flower of his age, was capable to taſte the ſmart and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his pain, to the very laſt moment of his life: and ſo 'tis written by S. <hi>Luke, that he cryed with a loud voice, when he gave up the ghoſt,</hi> to ſhew that he was ſtill very ſtrong, and that his death was bitter and violent to extremity. There was likewiſe an inviſible Croſs, which afflicted his ſoul, and made it ſorrowful even unto death; <hi>his heart was like wax, melted in the midſt of his bowels,</hi> Pſal. 22. and in the midſt of ſo many and ſuch intolerable pains, his murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſhook their heads, made mouths at him, ſcoft at his ſorrows by cruel and inſulting mockeries, and by their tongues and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions aggravated thoſe ſufferings, which

                     <p>THis Love of <hi>JESUS</hi> is more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by far, than ours can anſwer; Could our hearts burn perpetually with thoſe brighteſt flames of love which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Cherubims, could they contain all the moſt paſſionate affections of all Saints, both in heaven and earth, yet we could not love <hi>JESUS</hi> ſo much as he deſerves, for having died to ſave us from eternal death: and yet he did more: he ſuffered death that we might have life, that we might have eternal life: Not only that we might not be intirely miſerable, but alſo that we might be perfectly happy. Heaven is the purchaſe of the Blood of Chriſt, as well as Redemption from hell; <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, when we were dead in treſpaſſes and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103707:32"/> ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt, and hath raiſed us up, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2.5. Let us meditate a while, upon that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in heaven for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. and in it conſider the ſame dimenſions, as in the price wherewith it was bought, the Croſs of our Saviour: and it will greatly preſs and increaſe our obligations to love him.</p>
                     <p>It is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; each word is a part of its dimenſion. Firſt, the Breadth; it comprehends all joys and pleaſures, all things that are good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, all that can yield ſatisfaction, and create happineſs to a man: even that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible and increated goodneſs, which is the inexhauſtible fountain of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bliſs and Felicity; <hi>in whoſe preſence there is fulneſs of joy, at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Secondly, Its height. It is above the regions of the air, in the higheſt heavens; the ſublimity and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its glory, is expreſt, by being like the Angels of God; by ſhining forth as the Sun; by a kingdom, a crown incorruptible, a crown of life, and ſitting with the Son of God in his throne. Thirdly, its Depth. It is pure and unmingled, it admits of nothing afflictive: neither death nor ſorrow, neither hunger nor thirſt, neither pain nor anguiſh;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103707:32"/> 
                        <hi>all tears are wiped from their eyes.</hi> There is the abſence of all evil, and the preſence of all good; therefore 'tis called <hi>the joy of our Lord,</hi> than which, nothing can expreſs a greater: for God is intirely and perfectly happy, and ſo incapable of any ſorrow, that the leaſt ſight of the Beatifical viſion would turn hell it ſelf into a paradiſe. Fourthly and laſtly, its Length, its never ceaſing duration; it admits of no end or period, it is everlaſting, it is eternal, it is for ever and ever; after as many millions of years as there is drops of water in the ſea, it will but begin: and after as many thouſands of millions more, it will be no nearer ending, than it was at firſt, ſtill eternal, and ever eternal. This is that Bliſs which we had forfeited by ſin, and are reintitled to by the paſſion of Chriſt; that Bliſs which if often and duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would make us deſpiſe the world, long for heaven, love affectionately, and ſerve diligently that <hi>JESUS</hi> who offers it to us, and died to purchaſe it: Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> prays ſo earneſtly for the <hi>Epheſians, that God would give them the Spirit of Wiſdom and revelation, the eyes of their underſtanding inlightened, that they might know what is the hope of his calling: and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 1.18.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103707:33"/>
                     <p>That we might once be poſſeſſed of this bliſs, as well as delivered from hell, was the Cauſe why <hi>JESUS</hi> deſcended down from heaven, became poor, took on him the form of a Servant, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto death, even the death of the Croſs; <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he deſpiſed the ſhame and endured the Croſs,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 12.2. That <hi>joy,</hi> we may ſay, was not the injoyment of heavenly bliſs, for himſelf; 'twas his without ſuffering; there was no need he ſhould bear the Croſs, for to obtain it, he had a ſure title to it by nature: <hi>the joy</hi> therefore <hi>that was ſet before him,</hi> was the joy of ſaving us, the joy of reſcuing us from the jaws of death, the gulf of eternal perdition; the joy of paying the price of our Redemption; the joy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us capable of eternal joys; the joy of purchaſing the glories and felicities of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us, in a word, the joy of ſhewing us his love, and expecting the returns of ours. This was <hi>the joy,</hi> why, <hi>he deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> becauſe his ſhame ſhould raiſe us to glory; this was <hi>the joy,</hi> why, <hi>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Croſs,</hi> becauſe his Croſs ſhould exalt us to a happy and honourable Throne.</p>
                     <p>This meditation of the great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold benefits of God, and the wonderful love and charity, he hath ſhewed us, in <hi>JESUS,</hi> we may and ſhould proſecute much farther, in all inſtances, for 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;

'Tis <hi>the appearance of that grace of God which bringeth ſalvation,</hi> Tit. 2.11. that teacheth men to live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly and godly:</hi> and 'tis the receiving and crediting that Heavenly Doctrine, that <hi>quencheth the fiery darts of Satan, that purifies the heart, and overcomes the world;</hi> ſo that the bare belief of the truth of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is a ſtrong and indiſpenſable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to a cheerful, univerſal, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering obedience to all its precepts; the very profeſſion of being Chriſtians doth ſtrictly bind us to the performance of all Chriſtian duties.

Whereas now, by an after ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by free and conſiderate acts of thine own will, I would have thee often renew thy holy vows and proteſtations, and to do it with a great ſenſe of love, and gratitude. Ratifie then thy former ingagements by being confirmed, if thou art not, and if thou art, by a hearty and ſincere endeavour to perform thy vows and promiſes, which are as follows.

                     <p>LOve is the common Prince and parent of other paſſions, as they all take their Laws, ſo they take their Origine from it: Or, to ſpeak more properly, love it ſelf is all paſſions, and it obtains ſeveral different names, according to its ſeveral acts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Love <q>(ſaith S. <hi>Aug.</hi>) is called deſire,<note place="margin">Amor inhians habere quod amatur, cupiditu eſt, idem habens eoque fruens, laetitia eſt, fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens quod ei adverſatur, timor eſt, idque cum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderit ſentiens, triſtitis eſt. <hi>Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 14. c. 7.</hi>
                           </note> when it gaſps after its belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved object; when 'tis poſſeſt of it, it takes another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and is called joy or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when it flies from what it abhors, it hath the name of fear; and 'tis called ſorrow, when what it feared overtakes it.</q> But ſtill love is the only paſſion: deſire, anger, joy and ſorrow, hope and fear are either the motions or acts, or elſe the accidents of it. This clearly ſhews the great power and activity of this noble paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103707:38"/> for 'tis well known that the greateſt, and indeed all humane actions that are free, proceed from theſe natural affections, and ſo are the effects of love. There is no need, to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral ſorts thereof, declaring that love is, either natural or ſupernatural, ſenſual or ſpiritual, of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or of intereſt; for all theſe are the ſame faculty, or paſſion in man, differing in their principles or objects only: neither would it much avail to give and explain accurate and ſtudied definitions of love, which is much better felt than expreſt, and much better declared by actions than words: it will be more uſeful to conſider, that, as love is the principle of all paſſions, ſo it is of all vertues and vices. This foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſendeth forth the cleareſt and the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtreams; and like all other things, the greater its excellency, the worſe is its abuſe: ſo that it ſhould be our greateſt care, to uſe it well, and ſet it upon the right object.</p>
                     <p>No joy in enjoyment without love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it no pleaſure in fruition: it is the great inſtrument of happineſs, if we place it aright, and it brings the greateſt infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if we miſplace it. 'Tis a miſguided love that makes men vicious, that cauſeth all the diſorders in the world: becauſe men love themſelves more than God; and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103707:39"/> ſo would be Gods to themſelves, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their own happineſs, expecting their greateſt felicities, either from their bodies as the ſenſual <hi>Epicures,</hi> or from their minds, as the proud <hi>Stoicks.</hi> Hence it is, that in the head of a long catalogue of the blackeſt ſins, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets ſelf-love as the cauſe, and origine of all the reſt: ſaying, that in <hi>the worſt and moſt perilous times, Men ſhould be lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.2, 4. and again, that they ſhould be <hi>lovers of pleaſure, more than lovers of God;</hi> which, being the greateſt depravation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and of the will of men, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them into the greateſt ſins, and thence into the greateſt miſeries. Certain it is that piety or true goodneſs conſiſteth in willingly ſubmitting one ſelf to the Divine Pleaſure, either to ſuffer or obey: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that ſelf-love will admit of neither, it makes a man uncapable of Religion, the Eſſence whereof is to deny our own, to comply with God's Will: and ſo inſtead of that <hi>Godlineſs, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which are the three Generals comprehenſive of all religious duties, this muddy head-ſpring <hi>ſelf-love</hi> ſends forth three muddy ſtreams, which cauſe <hi>the overflowing of ungodlineſs,</hi> and almoſt drown the world under a deluge of wickedneſs. Theſe be the love of ſenſual pleaſures, called Voluptuouſneſs; the love of riches, called Covetouſneſs, and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103707:39"/> vain-glorious love of honour, called Pride or Ambition. Theſe three are diſclaimed and renounced by all Chriſtians in the firſt part of their Baptiſmal vow: for the love of them confounds the world and all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; makes men criminal in ſouls, bodies, and eſtates, and is the great enemy to their reſt and ſalvation. Therefore S. <hi>John</hi> who calls theſe <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> gives us this neceſſary cauti n; <hi>love not the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15. that is, as our Bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>no man can ſerve two maſters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the other: ye cannot ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Mat. 6.24. There is no <hi>halting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Baal,</hi> the one or the other muſt be acknowledged for Lord; there cannot be two contrary Sovereigns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the ſame thing cannot be granted to two ſeveral competitors; if we love the world it reigns in our hearts and God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: if we give our love to the world,<note place="margin">Amor motus eſt cordis qui cum ſe inordinate movet, cupiditas dicitur: cùm vero ordinatus eſt charitas appellatur. <hi>Aug. de ſubſt. dil. c. 2.</hi>
                        </note> we cannot poſſibly give it to God alſo; ſo then the love of our ſelves is Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, the mother of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103707:40"/> all ſin and impurity, and the love of God is Grace or charity, the fountain of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and vertue: and theſe two, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are predominant in men, make here the diſtinction betwixt the penitent and the impenitent, betwixt the juſt and the unjuſt: and will make the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hereafter, betwixt thoſe that ſhall dwell in the embraces of the God of Love to eternity, and thoſe that ſhall <hi>dwell with everlaſting burning;</hi> for every man is what he loves,<note place="margin">Talis eſt quiſque, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſt dilectio ejus, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram diligis, terra es, &amp;c. <hi>Aug.

                     <p>THis makes it our greateſt duty, as it is our greateſt intereſt, to rule by Reaſon and Religion that paſſion which certainly will rule over us, to ſet our love upon the right object, upon God, not upon our ſelves. Not that we ſhould, or can be our own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſeek our own ruine; <hi>no man ever yet hated his own fleſh,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 29. the worſt enemies to mankind are kind to themſelves: and we may as ſoon loſe our being, as the deſire of our well being.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt underſtand that our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream happineſs conſiſteth in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who is that infinite increated Goodneſs, that can alone fully beatifie us. God is infinitely happy and hath the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his infinite perfections by loving himſelf, and we alſo become happy by loving him with all our hearts and ſouls, it was ſo in the ſtate of innocency, and ſo it is ſtill and ever ſhall be, and Angels and men became miſerable only by departing from the love of God, which was then as 'tis now
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103707:41"/> to be expreſt by obedience: So that when man prefers any thing to God, he not only departs from his duty, but alſo from his ſovereign bliſs.</p>
                     <p>In the time of mans integrity, God was to be regarded and loved firſt and moſt of all, ſo it muſt be ſtill: the difference is, that then man did it naturally, and now by a ſupernatural aſſiſtance: he did it then by the grace of his Original Righteouſneſs, and now by the grace of the Goſpel; he did it then without reluctancy, now he hath ſinful appetites and paſſions which he muſt deny and mortifie, before he can do it. Therefore our bleſſed Saviour requires it, at the very entrance of his School, as a neceſſary qualification to all that will be his Diſciples, that they ſhould deny themſelves and hate all things in compariſon of him: <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his croſs daily and follow me: and again, if any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and ſiſters, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 9.23.14.26. that is, he that will own <hi>JESUS,</hi> and be owned by him, muſt in all things give him the preeminence; muſt relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his natural deſires, deny his own will, that he may yield an humble obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God; he muſt forſake all things that come in competition with him; and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103707:41"/> even part with his deareſt relations and his own life, (as though he hated them) rather than commit what God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or diſclaim what he would have us profeſs; this ſelf-abnegation,<note place="margin">Ille ſatis ſe diligit qui ſedulo agit ut ſummo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur bono.</note> this daily ſelf crucifixion is no act of ſelf-hatred, as the world might think: but the greateſt kindneſs we can ſhew to our ſelves or others: for 'tis the onely way whereby to make our lives comfortable here, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy in the world to come: and in many caſes more hard and leſs advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous we practiſe ſelf-denial, of our free choice. As he therefore that cuts off one of his limbs, hates not himſelf, but ſeeks the preſervation of his body; and he that caſts his goods over-board, hates them not, but prefers his ſafety to them: ſo in this caſe, he that parts with his earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hates them not, but prefers heaven to this earth; he that loſeth this preſent life, hates it not, but loves eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; and he that forſakes his friends or parents to follow his Saviour in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a good conſcience, hates them not, but ſeeks to win them to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by preferring his God and his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their unjuſt deſires. In this caſe the promiſe is verified, that he that parts with any thing for Chriſts ſake, receives an
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103707:42"/> hundred fold in compenſation: and he that loſeth his life, certainly finds it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hating our kindred and our own lives, is otherwiſe expreſt in S. <hi>Matthew; he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 10.37. As much as to ſay, that it is only required, that the love of God ſhould be predominant; that <hi>JESUS</hi> ſhould be dearer to us, than all perſons whatever; and that in the firſt place, we ſhould love God, with all our minds, with all our ſtrength, and with all our ſouls: for then afterwards, the love of our ſelves,<note place="margin">Recte novit vivere, qui recte novit amare. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <p>Now that Divine Spirit, which is the eternal love of God to himſelf, is given to us, in the grace of love or charity (which are one and the ſame) whereby we are all joined together into one body, and all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God; therefore in our holding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep <hi>the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.3. and we are taught, that <hi>the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt which is given to us,</hi> Rom, 5.5. and that <hi>the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt are all one,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. ſo that to come to the higheſt

                        </note> yet it may ſerve to good purpoſe to ſay ſomething of them; the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that love always embraceth what is good, either in truth or appearance: for Mans inclinations are ſtill the ſame, as they were in the ſtate of innocence; though much depraved: we ſtill purſue after what we think will make us happy; only we miſtake. Like the bramble in the fable, which having loſt a rich freight of the fineſt ſilks, and now takes hold of the coarſeſt ſtuffs to recover its loſs; ſo have all men a ſecret ſenſe, that they are faln from a ſtate of felicity, and have loſt a jewel of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value, which ſtill they eſteem and love, though they know it not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, to recover the eminency of their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103707:44"/> firſt ſtation, they are climbing upon every molehil, petty mountains of ambition; to recover their loſt jewel, they pick up every pebble ſtone; where they ſee a glimpſe of beauty, where they reliſh any thing of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there they ſet their love and affection, as if that were the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> which is but an imperfect ſhadow of it; ſo that we are like an infortunate lover, who, being ſeized by a phrenſy, forgets and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his Miſtreſs, and dotes on her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. We neglect God, and fall in love with thoſe things that have the leaſt impreſs of his perfection: and then, like Idolaters; we pay that worſhip to the work, which is due to the maker only.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ought we to take great heed, that we be not taken with every ſeeming beauty or goodneſs: but that we examine whether that be the thing which will make us intirely happy, and beyond which we ſhall wiſh for nothing. For if it be not, we muſt paſs it by, and ſeek further, and never reſt, nor ſet our hearts on any thing, till we have found that true and perfect good, moſt obvious and eaſie to be found, which being loved will be certainly poſſeſt, and being poſſeſt, will make us perfectly happy; and that is God alone. It is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

I am with him that ſeeks for me; he hath me already that wiſheth for me; and he that loveth me is ſure of me: the way to come to me is neither long nor diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; love makes me preſent to every lover.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſecond property of love is; that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſts and is never ſatisfied, until it be poſſeſt of the beloved object; This makes abuſed worldlings ſo buſie, ſo perpetually reſtleſs and active about the purchaſe of their beloved vanities: and this makes devout Chriſtians, like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to count themſelves to have apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe that are before, to preſs forward towards the mark, the price of their high calling, the object of their love and moſt paſſionate deſires. This reſtleſſneſs and activity of love found work enough for the Fathers of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts; whoſe indefatigable pains to mortifie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103707:45"/> their ſinful appetites; whoſe unwearied diligence to ſerve God; whoſe ſwift and violent motion heaven-ward is the object of our wonder, and upbraids our ſloth and negligence. They were almoſt wholly freed from the neceſſities of the body, which is the endleſs task and work of other men, and yet they were always employed; they had almoſt nothing to do, and yet were never idle; the love of Eternity, the love of <hi>JESUS</hi> kept them in action; they dwelt in peace, and yet were never at reſt. Our heart, which is the ſeat of love, can never be quiet, till it returns within Gods embraces, till it be poſſeſt of that infinite good, which all men love, though but a few know it. See the ſeveral plots and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of men in the world, 'tis love ſets them at work: 'tis to obtain what their blind affections run after, that they are ſo aſſiduous and ſo laborious. See the prayers and pious exerciſes, the ſelf-denials and mortifications, the manifold acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the great patience of Chriſtians in the Church: 'tis love alſo hath ſet them their task and makes them ſo diligent, ſo watchful till they have fulfilled it. We ſometimes wipe the tears from our eyes, and our ſorrows admit of joyful intervals; our anger doth not laſt always, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hatred is aſleep: but love like the heart wherein it dwells, can never ceaſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103707:46"/> to act and move till it ceaſeth to be;<note place="margin">Habet omnis amor vim ſuam, nec poteſt vacare amor in anima amantis. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <p>IN the third place, as love is active, ſo it is effective; it doth not ſpend it ſelf in uſeleſs and inſignificant attempts; its ſtrength is great, as well as its endeavours. Great are the dangers and difficulties which love overcomes; it carries the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious lover of honour through many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie perils to a fading laurel; it carries the covetous lover of riches through the moſt hard and ſlaviſh labours, to his falſe and treacherous Mammon; and it carries likewiſe the devour lover of <hi>JESUS</hi> through obedience and ſelf humiliation, through briars and uneaſie croſſes, through patience and the greateſt ſufferings to the enjoyment of his Beloved. Love can do all things, ſince it brought God down from heaven to become man, and die for man.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103707:46"/> 
                        <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Shall tribulation or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us; for I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8.35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As much as to ſay, that the power of love is irreſiſtible, that it anſwers all objections and conquers all obſtacles: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans high provocations and great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, love made the Almighty lay down the arms of his juſt vengeance, and open his boſom of mercy, to give his dear and only Son to man for a Saviour; <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3.16. And likewiſe man is enabled or rather forced by love to do and ſuffer any thing; as ſoon as Divine Love enters a mans heart, of proud, it makes him humble; of luſtful and intemperate, it makes him chaſte and ſober; of covetous, it makes him charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; of dainty and effeminate, it fits him to be a Martyr. No ill habits ſo deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but love can pluck them up; no croſs ſo heavy but love can bear it. <hi>Many waters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103707:47"/> cannot quench love</hi> (ſaith <hi>Soloman) neither can the floods drown it,</hi> Cant 8.7. No, the ſtrongeſt torrent of affliction is but like drops of water ſprinkled upon the fire, it increaſeth the flames and the ardency thereof. <hi>Love is as ſtrong as death,</hi> verſe 6. and death is very ſtrong,<note place="margin">Magnum verbum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ut mors dilectio; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificentius exprimi non potuit fortitudo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quis enim morti re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtat? ignibus, undis, ferre, regibus reſiſtitur, venit una mors, quis et reſiſtit? nihil illa for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, propterea viribus ejus charitas comparatur, <hi>Aug. in Pſal. 121.</hi>
                        </note> ſtronger than all viſible creatures. We daily fight againſt death and beat it back; by reſt and food and Phyſick, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the victory with it many years; but it is ever victorious at laſt; ſo is love, it never gives over, till it hath conquered all oppoſitions; its cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage increaſeth together with its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the more obſtacles in its way, the greater its endeavours, the more fierce its contentions. Death ſevers a man from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and diſunites what ſeems inſeparable: love alſo takes the lovers ſoul from him, and unites it to the beloved, ſo that he lives more in what he loves than in himſelf; <hi>love is as ſtrong as death;</hi> Death converts the greateſt ſinners, or at leaſt keeps them from ſinning at all, any longer: ſo doth love, it certainly mortifies all, even the moſt reigning ſins, it will not ſuffer them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103707:47"/> to ſin that love God. We can tame wild beaſts by induſtry; overcome the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the earth by labour; reſiſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry elements by Art and Phyſick; no evil but hath a remedy, only death hath none, there is no ſtriving againſt it: ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can better expreſs the irreſiſtible power of love, than to ſay that it is <hi>as ſtrong as death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt property of love I ſhall now mention, is, that love ſweetens bitter things, makes our labours pleaſant, and even our ſufferings delightful. How heavy is that yoke which is impoſed by an ungrateful hand? The Souldier preſt to the ſervice can hardly bear his arms: but he that is inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by love thinks them light and bears them with pleaſure; the ſlave that works in the Mines counts his very life a burthen: the niggard that works much harder likes well his drudgery, becauſe the love of riches is his task-maſter; he that ſerves his maſter out of fear works faintly and with a heavy heart: he that ſerves him out of love, doth it diligently and yet with chearfulneſs; the Chriſtian pilgrim who is driven heaven-ward with fears and terrors, goeth on with much reluctancy, and a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful heart: he that is <hi>drawn with the cords of love,</hi> follows with joyfulneſs, minds not the ruggedneſs of his way, and even rejoyceth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103707:48"/> in his wearineſs, becauſe it brings him nearer and nearer to his beloved: he that that could ſay, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> could ſay alſo, <hi>we rejoyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 'Twas the love of <hi>JESUS</hi> made primitive Chriſtians work hard and ſuffer much,<note place="margin">Nullo modo ſunt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſi labores amantium, ſed etiam ipſi delectant, ſicut venantium, piſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium: intereſt ergo quid ametur: nam in eo quod amatur, aut non labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, aut labor amatur. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <p>The love of <hi>JESUS</hi> hath prevailed; I find my heart wounded; I can no longer reſiſt the charms of his love; he hath wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſo long, and with ſo much kindneſs, that now my heart is his; I will <hi>love him, becauſe he firſt loved me.</hi> Now it repenteth me that ever I rejected his ſute, that ever I was unkind to him; it grieveth me that ever I countenanced and preferred his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, the luſts of ſenſuality, covetouſneſs, and pride, which I renounced in my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; I will now exclude them wholly; this is the firſt mark <hi>JESUS</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of my ſincere affection to him, that I will entertain nor careſs no longer thoſe his enemies, with whom I have had an unhappy intelligence for too long a time; henceforth, if they come near me, I will endeavour to drive them away; if they come after me, I will flee; if they perſevere in their attempts, they ſhall get nothing elſe, but ſhame and denials.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103707:50"/> rigors of Winter, when an unproſperous ſtorm ariſeth, you are gone, you leave them to die comfortleſs; they carry nothing of you, when they go from hence, but the bitter remembrance of your treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>JESUS</hi> is a moſt grateful lover, he ever returns love for love; he is ever found of them that ſeek him; to them that deſire him he ever gives himſelf; every true lover of <hi>JESUS</hi> is ſure to enjoy him: but you worldly enjoyments are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally moſt unkind to your moſt paſſionate lovers; ye flee from them that run after you; ye grieve and vex your greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, ye are ever uncertain, falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grateful. I will therefore never love you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; nay, I reſolve to hate and perſecute you; to mortifie and watch againſt my luſts, my pride, and covetous deſires. But <hi>JESUS</hi> ſhall reign in my heart; him will I love; him will I ſerve; him will I endeavour to pleaſe in all things; I will be wholly his; therefore I renounce all friendſhip with you that are his enemies; there can be no agreement betwixt the Holy <hi>JESUS</hi> and this ſinful world; <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15. <hi>Lord, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee grant thy people grace to withſtand the temptations of the world, the fleſh, and the devil, and with pure hearts and minds to follow thee, the only God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

                     <p>NOw to effect theſe good reſolutions, we muſt uſe means to bring our hears to a devout and Religious Temper, and ſo to keep them. It will not ſuffice that we intend well except we perform. We may ſoon be diverted from our beſt deſigns, either by temptations, or by the interruption of worldly buſineſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the revolutions of time which bring on us the ſnares and diſturbances of this life, muſt alſo bring with them the frequent returns of our pious excerciſes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties.</p>
                     <p>We muſt often recollect our thoughts and liſten to the Divine Love of our Bleſſed <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS.</hi> We muſt entertain our Souls with him; renew our religious purpoſes; and call to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103707:52"/> mind thoſe ſpecial conſiderations which uſe to affect us moſt of all. We muſt often reſort to thoſe fountains of Grace which God hath opened to his Church in his publick Worſhip, and the ſeveral diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his Word and Sacraments by his Miniſters. To theſe we muſt be ſure to add Faſtings, Alms and Prayers, than which we can do nothing more acceptable to God; nothing that can better declare how much we love him, and how heartily we devote to him our bodies, ſouls and eſtates. All theſe are not only means, but duties of Religion alſo, not to be omitted, upon any pretence whatever.</p>
                     <p>But now the following have more of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, leſs of neceſſity in them: but yet may have a good influence upon the inner man; may move our affections and declare or increaſe our devotion and our ſincerity. Such are the conſtant reading of good Books; ſet times of meditation and mental prayer; the enjoyning to our ſelves a ſtrict ſilence for ſome convenient time, to bridle our tongue and ſo to uſe it to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: and as it were to unſay and retract inwardly by hearty repentance what we have ſaid amiſs.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes like <hi>Hezechiah</hi> to turn our ſelves to the wall to mourn in ſecret; I mean, to retire from the world, and enter our cloſet, there to confer with God and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103707:53"/> our own ſouls, about Eternity and the way to a bleſſed one.</p>
                     <p>Every day, or at leaſt once a week to caſt our eyes back, and take an account of our lives, eſpecially of what we have done ſince our laſt examen: that we may repent and rectifie our follies, renew our good reſolutions, and increaſe our diligence and our care.</p>
                     <p>In our adorations and penitential pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to caſt our ſelve on the ground with the humbleſt proſtration; to hold our hands like criminals bound, ſupplicating before their judge; to look up to heaven; to ſmite our breaſts, and ſo excite our zeal and contrition.</p>
                     <p>Some are much affected with watching; with viſible repreſentations; the ſight of a dying man, and ſuch inſtructions and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentoes as enter the Soul by the eyes, which being the quickeſt and moſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive ſenſe we have,<note place="margin">Segnius irritant ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos demiſſa per aures, Quam quo ſunt oculis ſubjecta fidelibus &amp; quae Ipſe ſibi tradit ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor —</note> conveys its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the mind with the greater force, and makes the deeper impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Here in my firſt Edition I had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the making on our ſelves the ſign of the Croſs, which could not eſcape being taxt of Popery by ſome, that call by that name
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103707:53"/> every thing they diſlike. I ſhould not be much concerned at the charge, but that I find Popery is made a thing too ancient and too innocent, and ſo miſtaken. It hath indeed abuſed that primitive Ceremony and made it ſubſervient to ſuperſtition: but the right uſe of it is not therefore unlawful. Thoſe zealous and holy Chriſtians in the firſt ages who frequently ſigned themſelves with that Sacred Sign, intended it as a tacit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the name of Chriſt; as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion that they owned him for their Lord and Saviour; and as a ſignature to themſelves that they were devoted to his ſervice, and ready to die for his ſake.</p>
                     <p>I might produce and plead their reaſons and example; the Cuſtom of our Church, and its 30th Cannon, but that I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade no man to a rite ſo indifferent. If any will reiterate it on themſelves, where they give no offence, to the ſame purpoſe as it was intended, when they were made Chriſtians, <hi>In token that they will not be aſhamed to profeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall not condemn him: and I ſhall in no wiſe quarrel with them that omit it. If we ſincerely love our Divine Maſter, and are faithful and obedient to him, it is no great matter what outward means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments we uſe.</p>
                     <p>But yet experience and the approbation of the beſt of men, have recommended
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103707:54"/> theſe I have now mentioned, as many ways uſeful and profitable. They and others of the like nature, and Church ceremonies, are ſaid by <hi>Calvin, to aſſiſt our infirmities, to increaſe our devotion, and to make Religion more ſolemn and more venerable.</hi> Inſt. l. 4. c. 10. §. 28. &amp; 31.</p>
                     <p>So the great duties be ſecured, theſe are indifferent, and may vary according to circumſtances: but yet they are not uſeleſs, nor totally to be rejected. Thoſe outward rites and actions have an influence upon our hearts; they not only expreſs our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward piety, but they increaſe it. <hi>Though they proceed from the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103707:57"/> ſelf ſuch ſeverities, as may be proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and tying my ſelf to ſuch pious exerciſes, as I know will drive away the temptation. To forſake my ſins, is not to forbear drunkenneſs, when perhaps I am not inclined to it; or to avoid ſwearing, when I look upon it as an unpleaſing and unprofitable ſin; or to hate covetouſneſs, when by nature I am liberal: but, knowing what ſin pleaſeth me moſt, what vice my temper inclines me to, and what tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt ſtrong and importunate upon me, by my calling or my company, againſt that to fortifie my ſelf, and imploy the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my ſtrength; againſt that to watch and pray, and uſe ſincere and earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. To forſake my ſins, is not to ſay, I will forſake them. Some men, when they are called upon by fear, adverſity, or the ſecret voice of God within them, are forward enough to ingage with the Elder Brother in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord,</hi> I <hi>will go and work in thy vineyard:</hi> but their hot zeal and haſty promiſe, ſoon decays into negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and at laſt into a cold denial.

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103707:58"/> is more than barely to reſolve, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe high and proceed no further. <hi>They that are Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>have,</hi> not only verbally renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but actually <hi>crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. therefore now, I have given up my ſelf to Chriſt, and deſire ever to be his, I muſt pray hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and watch diligently againſt my ſins, thoſe eſpecially that are moſt pleaſing and cuſtomary to me; I muſt, like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not <hi>not fight in the air</hi> againſt generals, <hi>but keep under my body, be temperate in all things,</hi> and ſtrive to the utmoſt for the <hi>incorruptible crown;</hi> I muſt uſe that violence to my ſelf, ſuch harſh applications, acts of penance and mortification, of my own or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſicians appointment, as are fit and requiſite to cure my diſtemper, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or reform that evil inclination which is inconſiſtent with my love to <hi>JESUS.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that end it will be very uſeful fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to meditate on the paſſion of Chriſt, the day of our change, our appearance in judgment, the joys of heaven, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, and the amazing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eternity: and I am perſwaded that it would be an excellent inſtrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and very uſeful in many caſes, to acquaint the Spiritual Judge and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian with the diſtempers of our Souls and the ſtate of our conſcience. But what ever means we uſe for our amendment, we muſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103707:58"/> be ſure that they be effectual.

                     <p>BUT the voluminous directions of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts and Confeſſioniſts cannot reach all caſes and all particulars: to ſhorten our labour therefore, let the love of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> do the work of ſelf-reformation and it will be ſooneſt and beſt done. Love will find out the moſt effectual means for the extermination of our ſins, and love will uſe them to the beſt purpoſe. Certain it is, that love in all inſtances, ſets men upon acts of ſelf-denial; as great Generals and many more, who forego the peaceable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the comforts they might have at home, and expoſe themſelves to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, becauſe they love honour; merchants who forſake their deareſt relations, and run through many great troubles and perils, becauſe they love gain; and the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous love of friendſhip, which hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many to chuſe great incoveniences and even death to ſerve their friends: and therefore certain it is alſo that the love of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103707:59"/> 
                        <hi>JESUS</hi> will make his yoke and even his Croſs eaſie; will make us deny our ſelves and forbear what diſpleaſeth him, though otherwiſe pleaſing to us. <q>That men might be without excuſe, God hath made a ſhort work upon the earth:<note place="margin">

                        <hi>JESUS</hi> is the Center and the ſum of our Faith and Religion, and the love of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> is the content of our duty. <hi>I have determined,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) not to know any thing among you ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> and <hi>we preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs: but to them that are called, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. and 1.24. that is, in whom God fully reveals his will, and gives us full power to fulfil it. Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord; by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Gal. 6.14. The knowledge and love of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi> our Crucified Saviour, is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to teach us our duty, the greateſt motive to undertake it, and the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103707:60"/> to perform and effect it withall; it will kill our luſts, crucifie the members of the body of ſin, and carry us through the labours and difficulties of penitence and ſincere amendment: it will be the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of repentance, as it is <hi>the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, as love is ſtrong to overcome ſtrong enemies, to kill the greateſt ſins: ſo is it wiſe and quickſighted to ſee and to find out the leaſt. A loving friend will not only not ſlander and defame his friend, not rob, or ſtrike, or murther him: but will forbear all words and actions which might bring him the leaſt grief or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; love will not only not give the greateſt provocations; but even not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige or diſpleaſe in the leaſt inſtances.</p>
                     <p>And now my ſoul, I muſt apply this home, and thereby examine how true are my reſolves and proteſtations, if my love to <hi>JESUS</hi> my Lord be ſincere, it will not only keep me from confederation with his profeſt and greateſt enemies, but even make me ſhun and forſake the moſt ſecret and contemptible of them: I mean that the love of <hi>JESUS</hi> will never ſuffer me to entertain any the leaſt ſin; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I find that I have been unhappily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to commit any, it will cauſe me to grieve and ſadly to repent, that I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed my deareſt Saviour, and wounded
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103707:60"/> that tender love I owe him, and profeſs ever to have for him. And indeed, it is reported of many devout perſons, great lovers of <hi>JESUS,</hi> that they would ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and weep for ordinary failings, for ſmall omiſſions, more than others would, for much greater ſins. Divine Love, like a bright burning flame, will feel a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſturbance by the leaſt drop of water that falls upon it: a ſmall irregularity will be more grievous to a pious lover of <hi>JESUS,</hi> than great crimes to another. Therefore he that could ſay, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> would alſo highly complain, and groan under the ſenſe of our unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imperfection; <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Rom. 7.24. Nothing will make us more ſenſible of our leaſt and moſt common ſins, than the love of <hi>JESUS;</hi> it will make us angry at, and impatient of them, and earneſt and ſevere in reforming of them.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore as I profeſs my ſelf a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and affectionate lover of <hi>JESUS,</hi> I am obliged to undo, as much as may be, what I have done amiſs, and to do it no more: this earneſtly and vigorouſly I muſt now reſolve, and beg the divine grace an aſſiſtance to perform it. I muſt make amends and reſtitution to thoſe I have any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103707:61"/> ways damnified in body, goods, or name, and even ask their pardon for the injury: and then bewail my ſins, grieve that I have offended my Divine and loving Maſter, and beg his forgiveneſs,, and indeavour by tears and contrition to waſh away the ſtain: and ſpots wherewith my ſoul is polluted, and diſpleaſeth the holy eyes of the Holy <hi>JESUS.</hi> And ſo to own and to love <hi>JESUS</hi> my Maſter, binds upon me all the duties of holy penitence; repentance muſt now be my my work; and I muſt live like a true penitent. Eſpecially on <hi>Lent, Fridays,</hi> and ſuch other times as the Church appointed, and devout Chriſtians uſe for mortification, and more ſolemn devotion. I muſt then, and even every night call my ways to remembrance. And (beſides thoſe greater provocations wherewith I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my Lord, in the days of my folly and inconſideration) I ought alſo to take notice of thoſe ſins of daily incurſion I laſt committed; and weep over them all, and beg for pardon: and this I ſay, eſpecially on penitential days. For though true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition ſhould always abide in the heart of every one that truly loves <hi>JESUS,</hi> yet there are occaſions and proper times to bring it forth; when we are to make it our buſineſs to ſoften our hearts, and make them melt into penitent tears. Which muſt be done by religious exerciſes, pious
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103707:61"/> meditations, and ſuch acts of contrition as this.</p>
                     <p>My deareſt <hi>JESUS,</hi> I owe to thy kindeſt goodneſs, my being and all the bleſſings I enjoy; and I know that thou didſt come down from heaven to die on the Croſs, that I might not die in hell to eternity; to ſuffer a bitter and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death, that I might live in eternal joys. I hope to ſee thy glorious face, one day; I hope to receive a crown from thy graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands; I hope to dwell in thy bliſsful ſociety for ever. Deareſt Saviour, if thou wert upon earth, I would go all the world over to proſtrate my ſelf before thee, to kiſs the ground thy Holy Feet ſhould tread, to ſerve thee to ſhew my love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to thee. Deareſt Lord, I would now joyfully give up my life for thee; I would loſe the laſt drop of my blood to pleaſe and glorifie thee; I would die rather than deny thee. Why then, unhappy wretch that I am, do I offend thee, to whom I owe my ſelf, and all that I have? Why do I wound thee by my tranſgreſſions, who waſt wounded for them, by thy love? Why do I grieve thee, who purchaſeſt eternal joys for me? Why do I diſpleaſe thee, with whom I hope to live and dwell, and from whom I expect mercy and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why do I ſin againſt thee, whom I love with all my ſoul? and why do not I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103707:62"/> live to thee, for whom I would die. Lord, if what thou haſt done and ſuffered for me, be not able to win my heart, what canſt thou do more? but O break and yield ſinful heart of mine; open the way to tears and grief; and let the love of thy deareſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, enter, and fill, and ever poſſeſs thee.</p>

                     <p>SUch conſiderations and ſoliloquies as theſe will produce not only <hi>lacrymas doloris,</hi> tears of grief, but alſo <hi>lacrymas amoris,</hi> tears of love and true contrition; and moreover will make pleaſant all the ſeverities of repentance which are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable and ſo repugnant to nature: thoſe things that would be ungrateful, as acts of juſtice on our ſelves, or obedience and ſubmiſſion to a ſevere Maſter, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come delightful as acts of love to a gracious, beloved Lord. <hi>In amore nihil amari,</hi> in love all things are ſweet that are done or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103707:62"/> ſuffered, for the ſake of the beloved. <hi>I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. that great lover of <hi>JESUS;</hi> not that thoſe things are of their own nature plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, whether inflicted by our ſelves or others; 'twas <hi>for Chriſts ſake</hi> that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them. He likewiſe that by ſelf-denial, and revenge on himſelf, expreſſing his ſorrow for his ſins, ſhews his love to <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi> is certainly delighted with the moſt afflictive of thoſe voluntary ſufferings, as they are expreſſions of his love. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly 'tis ſaid of ſome Religious perſons, that their watchings, and faſtings, and all the ſeverities to which they had tied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as exerciſes of true repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in proceſs of time, ſo pleaſant to them by the devoutneſs of their affections, that they were affraid of having their Paradiſe here in this world, and conſulted their Spiritual guide about it. And certainly nothing but love could carry the primitive <hi>Solitaries</hi> and <hi>Coenobites</hi> through that uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardſhip they willingly undertook, and endured many years, and rejoyced in, and would not have exchanged for all the pleaſures in the world; they being perſuaded that thereby they recovered and ſecured the favour of <hi>JESUS</hi> whom they loved, and whoſe love they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103707:63"/> more than all worldly enjoyments.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid by ſome, that ſuch things are the effect of melancholy, or a forward and miſguided zeal, not of true piety. But let it be conſidered, that natural love it ſelf hath done, and ſtill doth wonderful things. The love of friendſhip, the love of luſt, the love of riches and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition have ſet men upon difficult attempts, have made them deſpiſe great dangers, have carried them through many labours and ſufferings, and perhaps as great as the moſt mortified Chriſtian ever undertook for <hi>JESUS</hi> and Eternity. This hath been and is ſtill the effect of Natural Love, and ſure Divine Love, whoſe object is ſo infinitely more excellent, may do at leaſt as much.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, things temporal ſeem great at a diſtance; but near at hand, they appear as they are indeed, mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: whereas contrariwiſe, things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as they ſeem ſmall and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afar off, ſo near at hand they appear great and immenſe, they overwhelm the mind. Hence it is, that dying men who are on the brink of eternity, are amazed at the thoughts and near proſpect of it, and expreſs great regret for their paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration, and promiſe great things for the future, if they might live longer:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103707:63"/> looking upon the world, as an empty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not to be regarded where eternity appears; and hence it is alſo, that they, who approach things eternal, and view them by meditation and contemplation are of the ſame mind, have the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them, and act accordingly: doing thoſe things which dying men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent they have not done. For indeed, it is no illuſion or deceit, but a great and real truth, that the world and all its concerns are nothing, compared to eternity: and that we can never be too careful to obtain eternal joys, and avoid eternal ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>How much the bleſſed Apoſtles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians were acted by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us to underſtand, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whilſt they looktnot on things viſi-and tranſitory, but on things inviſible and eternal, then their afflictions were <hi>light and but for a moment,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16, &amp;c. though they laſted many years, and were ſo great, that the very thoughts of them can make us tremble, yet they were light and momentary, whilſt they looked on eternity: and <hi>they fainted not, though their outward man decayed daily,</hi> by their great mortifications, and their laborious zeal to ſerve God; and all this, <hi>whilſt we look not on the things that are ſeen, but on the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103707:64"/> ſeen are eternal.</hi> So that it is the effect of a wiſe and moſt rational conſideration, to value and love him above all things, who by dying for us, hath reſcued us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, and obtained eternal happineſs for us: and to make it appear by all means poſſible, doing or ſuffering any thing that may manifeſt our love to <hi>JESUS,</hi> and aſſure us of a bleſſed eternity. It may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be feared that the indevotion and luke-warmneſs of very many, not the worſt of Chriſtians, will not make them acceptable to God, who declares that he will <hi>ſpue them out of his mouth that are neither hot nor cold,</hi> Rev. 3.16. and that their careleſsneſs and indifferency in religious duties, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure their eternal intereſt. However I think that it is a ſhame, to ſee <hi>Benedictins, Franciſcans, Carthuſians,</hi> and others, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the merriments, pleaſures and honors of the world, riſe up early, and late go to reſt, wear nothing but Cilices and coarſe cloth, feed poorly and lie hard: and all this, and much more to obſerve the Rule of S. <hi>Bruno,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or ſome other fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful or melancholy <hi>Devoto,</hi> who obliged them to ſome abſurd, ſome needleſs, and many uneaſie obſervations: from whom they never received any benefit, and from whom they can expect no kind of remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and at the ſame time to ſee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians nice and dainty, unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103707:64"/> themſelves of any pleaſure, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any thing of hardſhip, for to obſerve the moſt reaſonable, holy and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rule of Chriſt; from whom they have received the greateſt favours, from whom they expect the greateſt rewards, and to whoſe ſervice and obedience they have devoted themſelves, by a ſolemn vow, in holy Baptiſm.</p>

                     <p>I Know that ſome put too great a ſtreſs on ſuch outward obſervations and corporal auſterities, and whilſt they pervert the right uſe of them, greatly abuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it may be deceive others alſo: but withall it muſt be granted, that others, in the other extreme, as unadviſedly reject and condemn them as unprofitable and ſuperſtitious; and as unreaſonably count themſelves Religious becauſe they deſpiſe, as other becauſe they are fond of them. I ſhall not determine which of the two are in the worſt error. Both certainly are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103707:65"/> miſtaken; and the truth I apprehend to be this. The example of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is our beſt pattern and moſt profitable leſſon, plainly declares that ſuch exerciſes are of great uſe, if not neceſſity, in our ſpiritual warfare againſt ſin and temptations. So likewiſe the precepts of <hi>cutting off our right hand or foot,</hi> when they make us offend; of <hi>denying our ſelves, and taking up the Croſs;</hi> and many more to the ſame purpoſe, make it our duty to uſe the proper and appointed means of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that they are acceptable to God, we are aſſured by Chriſt himſelf; <hi>When ye faſt, be not as the hypocrites, but anoint thy head, and waſh thy face, that thou appear not unto men to faſt, but to thy Father which ſees in ſecret: and thy Father which ſees in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly,</hi> Mat. 6.18. Here faſting ſtands for all acts of ſelf-denial, as being the moſt afflictive: and though the meaſures thereof be not deſcribed, yet that God hath a great reſpect and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for it, as well as for prayers, and alms, is clearly affirmed by our Bleſſed Lord. So that their remains no doubt, but that all corporal auſterities prudently undertaken and managed, whether of our free ſuſception, or appointed to us by our Spiritual Guide, or the Governours of Chriſts Church, to whom we are bound to ſubmit our ſelves, (they being in his ſtead
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103707:65"/> to us;) there is no doubt I ſay, but that theſe, eſpecially the laſt, are generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable; in ſome caſes abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and always well pleaſing to God. They are inſtruments of Religion whereby our luſts are ſubdued; the body kept under; and the Spirit it ſelf mortified. They are marks of the ſincerity of our ſorrows, and our regret to have offended God. And they are teſtimonials of our love to <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi> and our earneſt deſire to ſecure our duty to him for the future. All this is atteſted and proved true, not only by holy Scripture, and the injunctions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church: but alſo by the practice and experience of all devout perſons, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lovers of the Bleſſed <hi>JESUS.</hi>

                     <p>Thus therefore meditate O my Soul, on thy days of humiliation.</p>
                     <p>My Bleſſed Lord, I know that I have been too much addicted to ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and now to ſpeak my grief for it, here I mourn and afflict my ſelf; judging my ſelf unworthy even of thoſe refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou haſt allowed me. I have too much ſerved Mammon, and been too gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the world: and now I devote all I have to thee; giving this as an earneſt that all I have is thine, and that now I will uſe it for my ſelf with more moderation, and ſpend it on others with greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that thou maiſt be acknowledged and glorified for thy gracious gifts, and I may ſpeak my dependence on thee. My heart hath been too far from thee, and for my negligence in thy ſervice, thou mightſt juſtly blot my name out of the liſt of thy Servants, but here I return to thee with tears and prayers, begging that ſtill thou wouldſt be my Lord and Maſter, and I may be more faithful and active in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thee. I pour out my ſoul before thee, deſiring it may evermore cleave unto thee moſt affectionately: and that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatever may ever be able to draw
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103707:66"/> me from that love and duty I owe thee.</p>
                     <p>Lord, had I offended any earthly Prince, that had power on me, in that grievous manner as I have offended thy Divine Majeſty, I ſhould be loaded with irons, caſt into a dungeon, and never admitted to ſee his face, and to beg his pardon. But thou giveſt me liberty and inviteſt me to plead for my ſelf; to come and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſelf at thy feet, to implore thy mercy, to retract my folly, and ſhew how much I am grieved for it; and if I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in this, I am aſſured of thy pardon, and that thou wilt receive me to favour again.</p>
                     <p>Lord, I beſeech thee, as it is written in thy Book that I have ſinned, ſo therein let it be regiſtred that I truly repent; that I judge and puniſh my ſelf; and indeavour what I can to undo and recall it again. Let the penance I here perform, my ſighs and tears, my prayers and bitter ſorrows, intitle me to the merits of thy precious blood; let them ſtand on record, that I may be juſtified at the laſt day, to have been a true penitent; that here the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have deſerved may be turned from me; that having been here numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy Servants, who duly own thee before men; I may hereafter be numbred among thy Saints, in glory everlaſting. And Lord, let my love to thee be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

                     <p>BUT one great half of repentance is yet behind; that which is moſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, that which I muſt chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in all acts of mortification is, that I return no more to thoſe ſins for the which I grieve and afflict my ſelf.

                     <p>Thus, when a provocation to anger is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I find my heart riſe, and my ſpirits take fire and grow turbulent; inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to the miſchievous paſſion, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that it ſhould proceed to hatred and revenge; I will turn aſide and check my ſelf with the remembrance of my meekeſt Saviour, <hi>who was led as a Lamb to the ſlaughter and opened not his mouth, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered the greateſt injuries, yet uſed no threatning, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> I will remember how ill it becomes me to be angry with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103707:68"/> others, who have ſo much reaſon to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with my ſelf for having ſo highly and frequently, provoked my God to anger; I will conſider how ill it becomes me to be revengeful and ſevere to others, when all my hopes, and all my happineſs depend upon forbearance and mercy; I will think of, and fear that juſt exprobration of my Lord againſt the revengeful, <hi>thou wicked ſervant, ſhouldſt not thou have had compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant, as I had pity on thee;</hi> and I will remember that it is <hi>JESUS</hi> who died for me, <hi>JESUS</hi> for whom I would die, who intercedes for mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and ſo will rather rejoice that I have ſome of that kind of love to repay to my deareſt Saviour, which he ſhewed to me when I was his enemy. If luſt enticeth me to acts of impurity, I will call to mind the corruption and diſſolution of this vile body of ſin; I will think on my laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the day of judgment, and the dreadful flames of hell; and I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, who for me was crucified, and with whom my love hath crucified me; and that now is the time to make it appear that I love him, and to juſtifie the ſincerity of my proteſtations. And ſo, for covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pride, intemperance, and all ſuch temptations, I will reject their attempts and proffers, with indignation, as a true friend would ſcorn the ſolicitations to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103707:68"/> his friend, thus ſaying to my ſelf, What, ſhall I be falſe to him I love, to him that loveth me, who hath ſhed his bloud for me, and to whom I have often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that I would even die for him? ſhall I break the ſacred bonds of love, and my moſt ſacred vows, and put my ſoul into a ſtate of regret, unquietneſs, ſhame and ſorrow for this vile tranſitory profit or pleaſure? O my deareſt <hi>JESUS,</hi> thou knoweſt that I love thee; I beſeech thee, make that love victorious againſt thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and mine. I would rather die than deny thee, for any intereſt in the world: and I hope, thou wilt not deny me at the laſt day, but own me among thy faithful ſervants. Lord, I ſerve thee not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; great are the reaſons why I ſhould obey thee: thou haſt done much for me, and from thee I ſtill expect much; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite rewards for ſuch due and poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; Lord, let me die before I delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately over ſin againſt thee, and forfeit thy love by falling from mine.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by love I reſolve to conquer my ſelf, to deny and mortifie my luſts; by love, I will ſtrive to overcome all unlawful deſires, all ſinful motions: and then I ſhall rejoice in the victory. It ſhall not make me either proud or peeviſh, or ſevere to others: but rather humble and meek, cheerful and contented; ſo that it ſhall be ſeen by my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103707:69"/> outward deportment, how much pleaſure and tranquillity my ſoul hath inwardly: that I rejoice in what I do for Chriſt; that it is delicious to me to deny my ſelf for his ſake, to oblige ſo great, ſo true, ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a lover as <hi>JESUS,</hi> who hath done all acts of friendſhip for me, and owns me for his friend. <hi>I call you not ſervants but friends, ye are my friends indeed, if ye do whatſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Joh. 13.14. Thoſe that are accounted gallant men in the world will venture their lives to ſecond a friend in an idle, an unchriſtian quarrel: and their wound they bear with courage and count them honourable, <hi>'T was to ſerve a friend;</hi> how much more ſhould I rejoice in that violence I offer to my appetites and unruly deſires; in what I do or ſuffer for to pleaſe and ſerve my heavenly, my beſt, my deareſt friend, whom I can never love ſo much as he deſerves: and in loving of whom, I am infinitely happier than if I ſhould enjoy all the pleaſures of ſin, as long as I live. I only grieve and am diſpleaſed that I can do ſo little for him, that I can requite his love no better. I know that many perſons have done far more for their leſs deſerving friends, than I do, or can do for my Saviour <hi>JESUS.</hi>

                        <q>IT is reported by Greek hiſtorians of two loving ſiſters, <hi>Eudoxia</hi> and <hi>Irenea</hi> daughters to the laſt unhappy Prince of <hi>Morea,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Niceph. Gregor. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condyſ.</note> who with his life loſt his Crown and Country; that an uncle ſaved them from the general deſolation and captivity which ſoon ſucceeded the loſt battel, and carried them to old <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> their kinſman, then Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> There, with pity, they found a kind welcome, and as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as they could wiſh. Their beauty, their vertues and accompliſhment ſurpaſt their princely birth, and were as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as their fortune was low: ſo that young <hi>Andronicus</hi> who was to ſucceed in the Empire, was in proceſs of time taken with <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> loved her paſſionately, and obtained the Emperours conſent to marry her. This cauſed great troubles to <hi>Irenea,</hi> who liked it well as ſhe loved
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103707:70"/> her ſiſter, but could not but grieve at it, as ſhe loved the Prince (for unhappily ſhe had ſetled her affections on him.) Upon this ſhe fell ſick, and almoſt to death: and it being obſerved that ſome diſtemper in her mind cauſed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of her body, her ſiſter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting of her love to her, aſſuring her that <hi>Eudoxia</hi> ſhould have only the title and the trouble, but <hi>Irenea</hi> the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and the power of an Empreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to declare what cauſed her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. Having underſtood what it was, and grieving that ſhe ſhould be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her ſiſters danger and ſorrow, ſhe preſently took from her head a jewel the Prince had given her, in form like a half-moon; and with it ſhe ſo wounded and disfigured her face, that ſhe cured the Prince of his love, as ſhe deſigned: and afterwards retired to <hi>Galliopoli,</hi> where ſhe entred a Cloiſter, and devoted the reſt of her life to God. The Prince finding in <hi>Irenea</hi> what he had loſt in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia,</hi> ſoon after entertained the ſame paſſion for her, he had for her ſiſter: but <hi>Irenea,</hi> remembring her ſiſters ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, forgot her affection to the Prince; conſidering what <hi>Eudoxia</hi> had voluntarily ſuffered for her, how great, how tender a love ſhe had expreſt in what ſhe had done, reſolves to forſake
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103707:70"/> 
                           <hi>Andronicus,</hi> to forgo her eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and what ſhe had ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, rather than be ungrateful. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe ſteals away from the Court, goes to <hi>Galliopoli,</hi> enters her ſiſters Cloiſter, and having expreſt to her her love and acknowledgments, ſhe takes the ſame vows, and reſolves to live and die to God, and with her beloved ſiſter.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſtory makes me grieve and bluſh, that ſo little gratitude ſhould be paid to <hi>JESUS</hi> for greater benefits, for that incomparable love he hath ſhewed men in dying for them; that I my ſelf ſhould ſo ill requite his much greater kindneſs, ſo poorly and imperfectly return his moſt wonderful love. What, ſhall I think it much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain my intemperance for his ſake, who, for mine, faſted long and often, and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vinegar and gall? ſhall I think it much to mortifie my pride and anger for him, who, for my ſake deſpiſed the ſhame of the Croſs, and returned nothing but meekneſs to the greateſt provocations? ſhall I think it much to refrain my worldly, covetous deſires for him, who, for me, became poor, naked, deſtitute of all things, though he were Lord of all; ſhall I think it much, to deny my ſelf ſome momentary ſenſual pleaſures, for him who carried my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, who ſhed his blood and was crucified to ſave me; No, my deareſt <hi>JESUS,</hi>

                     <p>THis Repentance and Reformation is what our Religion requires; The Scripture ſuppoſeth it in all that have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity, and is earneſt and preſſing in its exhortations to it. <hi>We beſeech you Brethren, and exhort you by the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, that as ye have received of us, how ye ought to walk and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more: for ye know what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments we gave you by the Lord JESUS, for this is the will of God, even your ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.1, 2. Again, <hi>but ye have not ſo learned Chriſt</hi> (as to follow the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and luſts of the Gentiles) <hi>If ſo be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103707:71"/> that ye have heard of him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in JESUS, that ye put off, concerning the former converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts; and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which, after God, is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.20 21. &amp;c. And in another place, this change, being abſolutely neceſſary, is abſolutely ſuppoſed to be wrought in us by our imbracing the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>If ye are riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above — for you are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God. — Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs which is idolatry — in the which ye walked ſometime when ye lived in them, but now, you alſo put off theſe, anger, wrath, malice, blaſphemy, evil communication out of your mouth; lie not one to another, ſeeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, &amp;c. In theſe and many more places to the ſame purpoſe, it is plainly implyed, that true Chriſtians are mindful and careful to fulfil their baptiſmal promiſes; <hi>to renounce the devil and all his works,</hi> &amp;c. It is not love alone that binds this duty upon us: our profeſſion abſolutely
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103707:72"/> requires it of all that have given their name to Chriſt, and expect Salvation from him. Love may inforce the obligation, and aſſiſt us to diſcharge it: but it is the deſign and the tenor of Chriſtianity it ſelf, to reclaim us from ſin; to ſanctifie our affections, that our lives and actions may be holy as becomes the Goſpel. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live in this preſent world ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly.</hi> Tit. 2.11.12. This is the ſum of our duty: that we ſhould be temperate in our bodies and minds, juſt and charitable in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with other men, and pious in our minds, devout in acts of Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God, the learning and practiſing this leſſon is that whereby the offered ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is obtained and laid hold on; that whereby we muſt make it appear, that we indeed own Chriſt for our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that we do truly love him with all our hearts and ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore I muſt remember that I am not mine own, I am his that made and redeemed me; I am his to whom I have given my ſelf, when I undertook <hi>manfully to fight under his banner againſt ſin, the world and the devil.</hi> To me is addreſt that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Thou, O man of God, flee theſe things</hi> (ſtrifes, diſputes and covetouſneſs,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103707:72"/> before mentioned) <hi>and follow after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, godlineſs, faith, love, patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.11, 12. I am become a Souldier of <hi>JESUS;</hi> to me S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, as well as to <hi>Timothy, Thou therefore endure hardneſs as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt. No man that warreth intangles himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Souldier,</hi> 2 Tim. 2, 3, 4. If I were in the Militia of any other Prince, I might endure hardneſs enough, before I could obtain his favour, or indeed be taken notice of; heat and cold, hunger, thirſt and wearineſs, ſleepleſs nights and perpetual dangers; all this, and much more I might endure many years, and not be looked on; here my General hath prevented me with his kindneſs; he firſt fought againſt mine enemies; he firſt loved me, and endured hardſhip for me; and he notes every thing I ſuffer for him, ſets it down, and aſſigns a reward to it. Under another Commander I might do brave actions, behave my ſelf valiantly, and yet not be ſeen: here my General hath always his eyes upon me, he incourageth me; and rejoiceth to ſee my fortitude; he is alway ready to help me, and is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, when he ſees me zealous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent. I might fight long enough for an earthly King, I could only get a poor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103707:73"/> or an empty fame, but never ſo much as one province of his dominions: here, fighting for my heavenly King, I ſhall get unvaluable treaſures, immortal glory, and a Kingdom which ſhall have no end, <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. I will therefore, never again, fight againſt the captain of my ſalvation, and I will never forſake him; I will often renew my vows, often ſwear allegiance to him, upon that ſacred blood which he ſhed for me, and which he gives me to comfort and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then my heart; I will daily think on thoſe things that may increaſe my zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and help me to reſiſt temptations; and I will ſuffer any thing, uſe all means poſſible to perform theſe reſolutions, and approve my ſelf unto death, a lover of <hi>JESUS. If any man loves not the Lord JESUS, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Have now gone through the greater half of my task, the negative part of our Baptiſmal Vow, and of our Duty. The greater half I call it, becauſe our Nature ſtands not <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> in an indifference betwixt good and evil, but is depraved and ill inclined: and the way to vertue will be ſmooth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, when once by grace and love we have renounced our ſins, and our vicious propenſities are both ſubdued and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>If therefore thou haſt entred and liked this Cloiſter ſo far, thou maieſt ſafely advance further, and go through what remains; if thou haſt approved and obſerved its Rules hitherto, the reſt cannot but be acceptable and eaſie to thee.
<pb facs="tcp:103707:75"/> As a Traveller in a ſtrange Enemy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try meets with many hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but at home amongſt friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in journeying: So the Love of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S among the works of the devil, the ſinful luſts and vanities of this world, might meet with difficulties and a rugged way; but now converſing with faith and good works, the holy will of God and his glorious rewards, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with joy, and a pleaſant ſpeedy progreſs.</p>
                  <p>I have called the Love of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S <hi>The Reformed Monaſtery,</hi> partly to work upon thy fancy, that by thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion thou mighteſt think thy ſelf as entred into a new ſtate of life, and cloiſtered in from looſe company and ſinful injoyments: and alſo to give thee to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that though thou beeſt not under any ſevere monaſtick ingagements, yet by thy being a Diſciple and ſervant of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S thou art bound to be ſtrict and watchful over thy ſelf; to uſe thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt ſins and temptations, and thoſe proper helps to devotion, which are
<pb facs="tcp:103707:75"/> uſeful and ſubſervient to Vertue and Religion, and will aſſiſt thee to ſecure thy duty and thy happineſs. Old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies we know often revive and appear under a new dreſs: and it may ſerve the ends of true goodneſs and piety to diverſifie Chriſtian inſtructions, and to bring them forth under new and different forms. What one is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved withall, may affect another; and the very novelty of a name or method may make that to be looked upon, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would paſs unregarded.</p>
                  <p>I know that I have fallen very ſhort of what my Subject could bear; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome will think that I have not been full enough in my particulars and in my directions: but my only deſign was to beget and entertain Divine Love in our Souls, well knowing that that love af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, would ſoon inlarge our hearts and our knowledge, and guide us right in all caſes. If I can but teach thee, Reader, to love JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S with all thy heart, I am ſure I have brought thee
<pb facs="tcp:103707:76"/> into the eaſieſt and the only ſafe way to Heaven. <q>He hath taught the beſt part of Religion and to the beſt purpoſe,<note place="margin">Praecipuam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianae pietatis por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem docuit, quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ad hujus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamavit amorem. <hi>Eraſ.</hi>
                        </note> who hath taught others to love it.</q> And they certainly love it, and obey it too, that truly love its Author the Bleſſed JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S. If we truly love him we ſhall afterwards refuſe him nothing. Where a man gives his heart, he will neither refuſe his hand nor his knee, neither ſervice nor worſhip; where he gives his Soul and affections, he will willingly beſtow all the reſt. God ſhall certainly command us, and all that we can diſpoſe of, without any reſervation, if we ſecure our love to him. Therefore Love is called <hi>the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs.</hi> It is the onely qualification can make us true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.<note place="margin">Alia virtus cum peccato, ſed dilectio tua omni peccato contrariatur, omni temptationi reſiſtit.</note> 
                     <q>No other vertue but may
<pb facs="tcp:103707:76"/> conſiſt with ſome ſin, love alone is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all; no other grace can reſiſt all temptations, love alone hath that unlimited power.</q> Nothing but love can enable us to diſcharge all obligations, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> All other gifts and vertues without love cannot fit a man for heaven, nor make him dear to God: but love can do it of it ſelf. Love JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and affectionately, and then you ſhall be ſure to live here to him, and hereafter with him to eternity.</p>
                  <p>As there are Dragons that are bright and glittering, and have precious ſtones in their heads; as there are Comets that have the light and the elevation of ſtars: ſo there are vicious perſons, falſe Chriſtians that are indowed with excellent parts, and are eminent in ſome vertues; but it profiteth nothing without love; <hi>If I ſpeak the tongues of Men and Angels;</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 13.1, &amp;c.) If I have the gift of propheſie and underſtand all myſteries; If I have
<pb facs="tcp:103707:77"/> all faith, ſo that I remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; if I give my goods to the poor, and even my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am nothing, and it profits me nothing, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>8.1.</hi> Of all other gifts and abilities it may be ſaid, as of <hi>knowledge,</hi> that they all <hi>puff up, but charity</hi> alone <hi>edifieth.</hi> Among thoſe creatures which ſtand and worſhip before God, there is not only a Man and an Eagle, which may repreſent perſons of great learning, fitted for high ſpeculation, but alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Lion and an Ox, whereby Chriſtians of meaner parts and knowledge are ſignified: for theſe are capable of love as much as the others, and 'tis love alone qualifies men to dwell for ever in the embraces of the God of love; for <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1</hi> John <hi>4.16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>God loves men, that they may love him,<note place="margin">Amat Deus ut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metur, nil aliud vult quam amari, &amp;c. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> and he onely requires that they

And though I may have recommended ſome things as means and inſtruments: yet I have preſcribed nothing as a duty, but the great obligations which were laid upon us, when we were baptized into Chriſt. So that in this Monaſtery all muſt enter and live, that would live in heaven: and the Rules and Orders of it, ſhould be obſerved by all that deſire to own Chriſt before men, and to be owned by him at the laſt day. I might indeed have here inſerted many, perhaps, not unuſeful directions, given by Ancient Fathers and Spiritual Guides, to ſuch as made profeſſion of greater piety and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lives than others: but they could not have ſuted with all conditions and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: therefore I have appointed no other

                  <p>Not that I would deny that places for Religious Retirement might afford many great advantages, in order to greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and heavenly mindedneſs: for I bewail their loſs, and heartily wiſh that the piety and charity of the preſent age might in a juſt and primitive meaſure reſtore to this Nation the uſeful conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of them.

<pb facs="tcp:103707:78"/> active life; ſome would be glad to find a place of reſt and retirement for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: ſome who, by melancholy or by <hi>the terrors of the Lord,</hi> are frighted from their ſins and from the civilized world into Quakeriſm, into an unhappy ſullenneſs and Apoſtaſie, would perhaps exchange their ſilks and laces for the coarſer garments of mortified profeſſors of a Monaſtick life: and find, among them, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and peace of the ſoul, which they vainly ſeek for, in their wretched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Brotherhood. Some who, upon great afflictions and ſudden changes of fortune, fall into a ſtate of ſorrow and tedious ſadneſs, and are left in the world to ſtruggle with the temptations of a diſcontented mind, would perhaps take Sanctuary in a <hi>Religious houſe;</hi> and give themſelves up wholly to JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, and forget their temporal ſorrow, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joys and meditations: and at laſt bleſs that ſtorm and ſhipwrack which caſt them into that unknown land of reſt and ſafety. Some, that are forward and
<pb facs="tcp:103707:79"/> ready to promiſe well and take good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, have not ſtrength enough to keep them, but are prevailed upon, by the importunity of thoſe temptations they meet withall in the converſe of men; they perhaps being fled from thoſe occaſions of ſin, might, by the good example and good inſtructions of a Religious Society, ſecure themſelves, and ſtand to their holy ingagements. Some who never loved the world, or that are grown weary of it, or have paſſionate longings for heaven, would willingly free themſelves of the cumbrances and diſtractions of worldly buſineſs, to enjoy the leiſure and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of meditations, devotion, and other ſpiritual exerciſes. And ſome that are much taken with the ſtrict lives, and beads and oriſons of Papiſt-Friers, would look home and ſpend their commendations on the purer Religion, and better ordered lives and devotions of thoſe, in this Church, that ſhould wholly devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God. However 'tis not to be denied, but that men are much affected
<pb facs="tcp:103707:79"/> and influenced by the place, the company, the way of living, and the outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances wherein they are ingaged: and, I believe, it might be now as true a proverb as ever, <hi>Benè vixit qui benè latuit,</hi> he lives beſt and moſt ſafe, who is leaſt acquainted with the world, and lives fartheſt from it.</p>
                  <p>I might add further, that ſuch pious foundations or reſtitutions, might be ſo ordeoed as to afford a very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our Church and Religion. For thence perſons of good parts and great piety, devoted to the advancement of the true Chriſtian Faith, and free from thoſe cares and cumbrances that are upon others, might be ſent as <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> to make it their buſineſs to reclaim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ſorts from ſchiſm, errors, and hereſies, and even from looſneſs, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion.</p>
                  <p>Not but that we have an abundant ſupply of perſons very well fitted for that bleſſed imployment, from our great Seminaries of Learning. But their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:103707:80"/> attendance upon their Miniſtry and particular Cures, beſides other avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, deprive them of the leiſure and opportunities of running after their ſtrayed ſheep. They can well guide and feed ſuch as duly keep within their folds: but ſuch as break out and wander, they have not time to ſeek after. And yet great is the number of theſe, eſpecially about great Towns; where ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and ſtiff oppoſition are a great hindrance to the gaining of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; This excellent and charitable work, could be beſt done by them that ſhould have nothing elſe to do.

                  <p>But though we want ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for withdrawing from temporal affairs, to mind eternity and our ſouls the better: yet we muſt go to heaven; wherever we live, we muſt live to God, that we may live with God; therefore

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y former diſobedience and rebellions againſt my Bleſſed Lord and deareſt Maſter, I have examined and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I have conſidered that by ſin I wound and crucifie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103707:82"/> him afreſh, and therefore have reſolved to ſin no more, never to lift up hand or heart againſt him. But will love, be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this; is it a ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, not to abuſe, not to injure a friend? No ſure, I muſt proceed further; love requires more than this. I muſt not only abſtain from what would anger him I love: but I ſhould further do that that will pleaſe him. 'Tis part of my duty, as it was of my vow, not only <hi>to renounce the Devil and all his works;</hi> but alſo <hi>to believe all the articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and to keep Gods holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of my life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, I believe them from my heart, and reſolve to own and confeſs them whilſt I live; I never will diſpute or object againſt them, and I hope, I ſhould chuſe to die, before I would renounce any of them; as for other leſs neceſſary doctrines, I will be guided by my Spiritual Governors; in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, I will ſubmit to the judgment of that Holy Church, in whoſe Communion I live; and ſo I will read and ponder Gods Holy Word, eſpecially the new Teſtament, that I may know my Maſters will, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to do it: not that I may find out new myſteries and maintain the private opinions of a party. It remains then only, that I ſhould <hi>keep Gods Holy Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103707:82"/> and walk in the ſame all the days of my life.</hi> And this I alſo undertake; it ſhall be my daily and conſtant ſtudy and endeavour; I reſolve to obey to the utmoſt of my power: and I alſo promiſe further to manifeſt my love by free-will-offerings, as God ſhall enable me.</p>
                     <p>But firſt my love is to appear by doing what is commanded; <hi>This is the love of God that we keep his Commandments</hi> (ſaith S <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.) and <hi>he that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and keepeth them, he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me,</hi> (ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14.21.) There can be no love without obedience, this is its firſt and chiefeſt Tryal; <hi>if a man love me, he will keep my words,</hi> ver. 23. Now then, ſhould my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lord ask me, as once he did S. <hi>Peter,</hi> N. N. <hi>doſt thou love me?</hi> would not my heart anſwer, with his zealous Apoſtle, <hi>Yes Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee; —I would lay-down my life for thee,</hi> John 21.15. and 13.37. Now, to this he replies again, <hi>if thou loveſt me, keep my Commandments,</hi> John 14.15. Every time we tell him, <hi>Lord I love thee, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> He doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer again, <hi>if thou loveſt me, keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> So that, without we obſerve this, we can no ways pretend to love him.</p>
                     <p>I am therefore to take notice of, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103707:83"/> amend ſins of omiſſion, which too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among Chriſtians mind little, or not at all. In the matter of ſobriety I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether I eat or drink, to do it, as all things elſe, to the glory of God; and to be contented, whatſoever ſtate I am in; for chaſtity I am commanded to know how to keep my veſſel in ſanctification and honor; for acts of corporal and ſpiritual mercy, I am commanded to be merciful, as my heavenly Father is merciful, and to forgive injuries as I deſire my ſelf to be forgiven; for reverence to my betters, I am commanded to honour and obey my ſuperiors Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; in what concerns Divine Worſhip, I am bound to read and pray, and meditate, to inſtruct my ſelf and family, to receive the Bleſſed Sacrament, to have a veneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for all things that belong or relate to God, and him to love and fear, and truſt and adore evermore. All theſe, with the particulars included in them; and all other duties, and the ſpecial precepts of the New Teſtament, is the task I chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undertake, and in the performance whereof, I will approve my ſelf a ſincere lover of <hi>JESUS.</hi>

Do not I ſee what pains moſt men are at to get a ſubſiſtence for this world? how they run and ſweat and ſpend themſelves to provide for this periſhing life; which yet is miſerable, ſhort and uncertain? and ſhall <hi>I not labour for the meat which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to eternal life?</hi> ſhall I be at no pains to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that life which hath no end, and knows no miſery?

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103707:84"/> to be one of thy hired ſervants, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſo I love and obey beſt. O let me, like thy ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> ever <hi>have a reſpect to the recompence of the reward,</hi> ever conſider what I ſhall get by ſerving thee, that I may be diligent, perſevering and cheerful in doing my duty. O my ſoul, bluſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how laborious men are for the unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying acqueſts of this earth; how eager thou haſt been thy ſelf in purſuing of them; how ſlothful, how unactive and heavy thou art in working for eternal reſt, for the treaſures of eternity, for the glories of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for thoſe Divine Pleaſures which are at the right hand of God for evermore. Whence comes this, unhappy ſoul, is it not from inconſideration? becauſe thou doſt not lift up thine eyes to ſee whither the way of love and obedience will bring thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt not look beyond the world, upon things eternal; becauſe thou doſt not often enough meditate upon heaven and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; that unvaluable, infinite recompence which awaits thee, as ſoon thy work is finiſhed. Reſolve therefore to amend this, and daily, once at leaſt, to conſider what are thy wages, what thou ſhalt get by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.

                     <p>BUT, Though it may encourage us to love that gracious God who gives ſo very much for that little we are able to do, yet Love it ſelf is not mercenary; <hi>charity doth not ſeek her own,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.5.) we may deſire our promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſet our affections upon it, as it is a demonſtration of Gods infinite love and goodneſs: or becauſe it will be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of our duty and thankfulneſs, when we ſhall love and glorifie and adore God perfectly and for ever: or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reward is God himſelf, who will be to every faithful ſervant, his <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> Gen. 15.4. as well as to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abraham:</hi> rewarding ſincere obedience with the fruition of himſelf, being all in all to his Saints. But ſtill I ſay, Love is not ſelfiſh, but free and generous, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were to be gained by it, it would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103707:87"/> have great ſatisfaction in ſhewing it ſelf: the work and labour of love is a noble plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to a pious heart. When he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on his obedience and thinks with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. By the performance of this duty, by this act of vertue, I ſerve my deareſt Lord, I oblige my beſt friend; I expreſs my love to him whoſe infinite kindneſs to me hath conquered my heart, whom I love as my own ſoul, to whom I wholly give my ſelf, and for whom I deſire both to live and die.</p>
                     <p>O happy ſoul, who feeleſt what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy it is to love <hi>JESUS!</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unhappy ſoul, who canſt ſhew ſo little love to <hi>JESUS!</hi> Unhappy neceſſities of a frail body, unhappy diſtractions of a troubleſome world! Why am I, by you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the continual pleaſure of waiting continually on my Divine and moſt loving Maſter? But bleſſed be my gracious Lord, that I might have more opportunities of pleaſing him, and expreſſing my affections to him, he hath made vertues of neceſſities, he hath turned nature into grace, and of humane duties he hath made acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In relieving mine own and others wants, if I obſerve the rules of ſobriety and charity, he takes occaſion thence to bleſs and reward me, as if he were thereby glorified. In diſcharging the duties of my place and calling, if I am diligent and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103707:87"/> faithful; though my work be never ſo mean, he owns it as a ſervice done to him. <hi>Servants</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) obey your maſters in all things, and do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Col. 3.22, 23. If I am conſcientious in all my ways and works, he takes it as a mark of my love and part of my duty to him. O that the conſtant courſe of my converſation might ſpeak the ſincerity of my affection to my bleſſed Lord. Deareſt <hi>JESUS,</hi> the Croſs thou didſt bear for me was heavy and painful to extremity: but thy yoke is light and pleaſant, thy ſervice is perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. O let it be my delight and daily employment as it is my duty, to ſerve and obey thee, to follow thy bleſſed example, and be inſtrumental in winning hearts to thee: let me love thee ſo intirely that I may love nothing but thee, nothing but for thy ſake; <hi>Fac precor Domine, me guſtare per amorem quod guſto per cognitionem, ſentiam per affectum,</hi>

                     <p>COnſider O my ſoul, how deceitful, how vain is this preſent world; how inconſtant and unſatisfying; how vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and troubleſome. Doth not thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tell thee, that the more thou loveſt the beſt of earthly thing, the more croſſes and ſorrows befal thee? the more thou enjoyeſt of them, the more weary thou art, the farther from happineſs and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment? I have obſerved that the dead are ſoon forgotten, and that the world nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor indeed takes care, to do any thing for its greateſt ſlaves and admirers after they are gone: and yet our greateſt toil and vexation is to live here, ſo as to pleaſe the world. We are not pleaſed to have our wants ſupplied and to be free from pain, except the world be pleaſed alſo. That imaginary life which we live in the account of others, is by far the more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and the more uncertain; for we are never well except others will think us to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103707:88"/> be ſo. But O my ſoul, why doſt thou cumber thy ſelf with ſo many things; even with things that have no exiſtence but in thine, and other mens fancy? <hi>one thing is neceſſary;</hi> love God, and ſeek his heavenly Kingdom, and thou art rich and happy to the full.</p>
                     <p>Let thy thoughts wait one while on the moſt proſperous ſinners in the world; how empty is their ſoul; how diſtracted their mind; how reſtleſs their conſcience? Do they not live in a ſtorm and hurry? and at laſt ſink into the grave, with the greateſt regret and bitterneſs? and what would they not give in the day of vengeance, that they might paſs from the left to the right hand of their Judge. Conſider and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with what amazement and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent rage they will ſtruggle to change their place, that they might change their doom! But now turn and follow the juſt. See their inward peace and their ſecret joy; what comfort they have in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; what hope in their lives; what undaunted aſſurance in their death! but who can expreſs thoſe endleſs pleaſures, thoſe raviſhing joys wherein they enter, when they come to enjoy and ſee him face to face, whom here they loved and ſought after? O my deluded heart, be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by vain appearances; that is certainly true, which ſhall be true at laſt, and ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103707:89"/> remain unchangeable to eternity!</p>
                     <p>If it be ſo, that indeed thou muſt die, and one of thoſe two ſtates muſt be thy portion for ever; then put on now thoſe affections, which thou ſhalt certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain when thou ſhalt be near to expire; look upon things now, as thou ſhalt at laſt, and it will make thee wiſe; and make thee ſee the Truth naked; <hi>For that is certainly true which is true at laſt: and all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearancces are but varniſh and illuſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dwell ſeriouſly upon this conſideration, and it will make thee clearly ſee, that true wiſdom is to love and fear God: and the greateſt happineſs, to live under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; to be in his favour, <hi>whoſe loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That one conſideration well weighed, will make thee underſtand, that there is no great worth or pleaſure in thoſe luſts and vanities thou didſt renounce, when thou becameſt a Chriſtian; that thy vow was onely the renouncing of thy greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. 'Twill make thee underſtand, that it was no great hardſhip thou didſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, when thou promiſeſt to ſerve God, and be a Souldier of <hi>JESUS</hi> under the Banner of the Croſs; That 'twas only the obliging thy ſelf to be truly happy, and to enjoy perfect Freedom.</p>
                     <p>And now my ſoul, conſidering that of neceſſity thou muſt either by ſin ſerve the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103707:89"/> Devil, and deſtroy thy ſelf: or by vertue and piety ſerve God, and gain eternal bliſs; what ſhouldſt thou do, but intirely devore thy ſelf to thy Bleſſed, thy beſt Maſter? Breathing out heavenward ſuch Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe,</p>
                     <p>My deareſt Lord, I was once brought and preſented to thee, when through the waters of Baptiſm I paſt into thy Family and became thy Servant. Lord, I do here repeat the ſame oblation, and now again yield my ſelf to be thine. Here I do from my heart diſown and bewail all thoſe acts of mine, whereby at any time I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned or diſpleaſed thee; could the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my blood recal or expiate them, I could freely pour it out and die.</p>
                     <p>Wherein ſoever I have behaved my ſelf as if I were not thine, I here, what I can retract it with regret and ſorrow. Lord, pity my weakneſs and pardon my folly, and let me be received again into the number of thy Servants. I am ready to do or ſuffer any thing thou ſhalt pleaſe, ſo I may ſtill belong to thee. O let our firſt contract, my Baptiſmal ingagement ſtand, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my breach of it. I reſolve now to mind and obſerve it better; aſſiſt me ſweet <hi>JESU,</hi> and let me ever live to thee.</p>
                     <p>Lord, now I as heartily yield up my ſelf to thee, that I may love and obey thee:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103707:90"/> as I ſhall when I die, that thou maiſt ſave me. I had rather ſerve thee than be the greateſt Prince on earth. I had rather obey thee, than command all mankind. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy favour to all the riches of this world. I had rather ſuffer, and even die for thee, than without thee to have all the pleaſures and the joys of this life. Lord, I will love, and ſerve thee for ever.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ALL this, and much more to the ſame purpoſe, which I have read and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Sacred Books of the new Teſtament, hath convinced me that it is the deſign of Chriſtian Religion to make me meek and humble, ſober and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, juſt and charitable, devout and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, vertuous and holy: this I own to be my duty, and I will endeavour my ſelf heartily to perform the ſame. And that I may do it with cheerfulneſs and affection, I will ſtir and quicken the holy fire of love in my heart, by pious conſiderations. When any duty to God or man calls upon me for action and performance, and I find in my ſoul too much of dulneſs or reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I will again by meditation ſuppoſe my dying Saviour preſent, telling me, how much he hath done and ſuffered for me, and deſiring me, as I love him, to do that duty which lies before me. <q>Chriſtian, if thou doſt underſtand the greatneſs of my
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103707:97"/> love which brought me here to die for thee; if thou art ſenſible of it, and wouldſt make any return for it, do this, obey this command; this may be the laſt thing thou ſhalt ever do for me, this may be the laſt tryal of thy love: ſure it would grieve thee to have denied this ſmall requeſt to him that gives his life, that gives himſelf for thee.</q> Or elſe I will ſuppoſe my ſelf in the preſence of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maſter ſitting on his heavenly Throne with his glorified ſervants about him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the crown he hath aſſigned to me, and ſaying; <q>N. N. wilt thou deny to do this at my earneſt requeſt? wiit thou be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to me? Sure I have deſerved better at thy hands; ſure I, who am much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thee, have done much more for thee, than that comes to; but beſides, I would highly recompence thee. Theſe my friends I have rewarded with the bliſs and glory they enjoy, for having done ſuch things for me: and I would reward thee as bountifully: here is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, eternal reſt, eternal glory for thy recompence: as thou loveſt me, as thou loveſt thy ſelf, obey, that thou maiſt be happy.</q> To this, what anſwer could I make, but ſuch as this? Lord not only this, but any thing elſe thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am willing to fulfil and obey. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail my dulneſs and depraved nature that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103707:98"/> makes me ſo unready, ſo unactive in thy ſervice: but Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee. I would undertake any labour, any trouble to make it appear; I would die to juſtifie it. Yet, ſweeteſt <hi>JESU,</hi> I beg of thee to increaſe my love; to increaſe it to ſuch a degree that, like thy heavenly attendants, I may burn with that Divine fire, and be all love to thee: that ſo I may be always prepared and deſirous to do thy will. <hi>Stir up, we beſeech thee, O Lord,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſtian, I would here adviſe thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſs further. That thou wouldſt not judge of ſeveral things in this Book, by thy preſent liking of them. Devotional things are diſcerned more by the affections than by the judgment; the reliſh of them doth depend upon the temper of the Soul. And ſo thoſe reſolves and meditations which now, it may be, pleaſe thee not, may hereafter be very acceptable, when thou art otherwiſe diſpoſed; to be ſure when thou art ready to leave the world, and enter thy portion of Eternity. If now therefore thou wilt bring thy mind to ſuch a frame as then it will be in, I need not fear but that what I have writ, thou wilt alſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103707:98"/> read and repeat heartily in the firſt Perſon: for to that end I have thus contrived it to ingage thine affections, to make thee ſpeak, as of thy ſelf, theſe ſoliloquies, acts of love, and acts of reſolution which run through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole diſcourſe. It may affect thee much, and to good purpoſe, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to confer with thy Soul and with thy Saviour, about thy duty and thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. However be ſure thou beeſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſincere. For certain it is, that for thee N. N. by name, <hi>JESUS</hi> was crucified and died; and certain it is, that thou thy ſelf ſhalt die and be judged, and riſe again to an intolerable eternity, if by careleſneſs and inconſideration thou haſt been unmindful of thy Lord and thy ſoul: or elſe riſe again to eternal joys, if thou haſt ſincerely loved and ſerved <hi>JESUS. If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abide in his love,</hi> John 15.10.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That Love will prompt us to free-will offerings, and things it never doth enough.</head>
                     <p>THus much of neceſſity muſt be done; my duty as well as my love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me to it. Not to break negative precepts and to obey poſitive ones, (that is, to ceaſe from ſin and to work righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,) is required of me; if I do it by love, I have made my task pleaſant: but yet a task it is, which muſt be fulfilled. Not but that there is mercy for ſins againſt the New-covenant, for the tranſgreſſion of Goſpel precepts; there is joy in heaven at the converſion of a ſinner, whatever his ſins have been; and it ought greatly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear God to us, that he is ſo willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, ſo deſirous to have us repent, that we may be capable of his pardon: but whether ſoon or late, whether after crying guilts or ordinary ſins, ſtill I ſay, there muſt be a true contrition, a ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for our ſins, proceeding from the love of God, and a ſincere endeavour to pleaſe and obey him for the future; and ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103707:99"/> thus far we are drawn by a moral neceſſity, by the deſire of our own happineſs, which is not to be obtained any other way. But ſhall we ſtay juſt here, and not go one ſtep further than is required? 'tis well indeed when we are ſafe, and that muſt be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red firſt of all, and with the greateſt care; but ſhall our love proceed no further? Sure that Chriſtian who is beſt aſſured of his ſalvation, will love God moſt of all, and make to him the greateſt and moſt hearty returns. When a man is qualified for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and enjoys the greateſt happineſs this world is capable of; that is, a ſenſe of Gods favour and a well grounded aſſurance of a future bliſs, his ſoul cannot but melt into the moſt affectionate love for that gracious God, whoſe mercy and loving kindneſs hath brought him into that happy condition, and fitted him by his grace for a much happier; they, I ſay, that are in ſuch a caſe (for they only can be capable of what I now treat of may well do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than what needs they muſt; may well enlarge their affections to God, beyond the bounds of preſcribed duties. It is a good ſign, a ſign of a ſincere and a pious heart, when a man is forward to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for God: when he doth not weigh grains and ſcruples, leſt he ſhould part with any of his right and liberty: but affords God a full meaſure and running over, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103707:100"/> thinks he never gives enough, and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that he might do infinitely more for him. 'Tis true that properly ſpeaking, all is due to God: and the more any, the beſt Chriſtian returns, the more he hath received, and ſo the more he is indebted; but yet, God is pleaſed not to require all that he gives, nor all that we may give, that we may have wherewith to make a free-will-offering; that we may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give him, that he requires not, tokens of our greateer love and gratitude. It was foretold that under the Goſpel <hi>in the day of Chriſts power, his people ſhould offer him free-will-offerings with an holy worſhip.</hi> Pſal. 110.3. And <hi>David</hi> himſelf, under the Law, was at his <hi>quid retribuam, What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits that he hath done unto me?</hi> Pſal. 116. Though the benefits which God vouchſafed his people then, were much inferiour to them he hath ſince beſtowed upon us; (<hi>for eye had not</hi> then <hi>ſeen, nor ear heard, neither was it entred into the heart of man,</hi> what great things God would do for them that love him, as he hath now declared in the revelations of his Goſpel,) though he had tied them to a burthenſome and moſt expenſive ſervice: yet he accepted their voluntary vows and ingagements, and was well pleaſed with them: yet he would receive their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will offerings, and delight in them. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103707:100"/> ſure we are more obliged than the Jews to let our love and gratitude break forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of commands and expreſs injunctions: and now that God hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us his rareſt treaſures, his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for to give us his beloved Son, he will not reject our free oblations, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acknowledgments of his undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and unſpeakable mercies. 'Tis not to be denied (without giving the lie to the learning and piety of the beſt Chriſtians in all ages) but that there is in the New Teſtament counſels as well as precepts, ſome things recommended, though not commanded. He that ſells all that he hath for to buy <hi>the pearl of great price,</hi> and they that make themſelves <hi>Eunuchs for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</hi> were not injoined ſo to do, but are well approved of: and that God who gives a plentiful harveſt to him that ſows bountifully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. is doubtleſs well pleaſed with his open handedneſs and charitable profuſion. And as it is the beſt indication of a devout and loving ſoul, cheerfully to exceed what is ſtrictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: it is alſo the beſt ſence to immure and ſecure our duty; for then when we ſlack and abate, we may be ſtill within our due bounds. Nay more, I am confident that as it is beſt and ſafeſt, it is alſo eaſier, to give free will offerings, than only, juſt to pay the daily commanded ſacrifice,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103707:101"/> becauſe thoſe proceed from affection, theſe perhaps only from injunction. A friend deſired to go one mile, goes two or ten, and finds his way pleaſant, becauſe love leads him: but he that is preſt to the ſame journey, and is acted by fear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, while he reſolves not to go one foot farther than needs he muſt, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be tempted to ſtay one ſhort of what he ſhould.</p>

What by pride and refractorineſs, what by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and indevotion, and what by looſneſs and ireligion, that obedience which ought to be paid to <hi>thoſe that have the rule over us in the Lord,</hi> to the ſtanding rules and orders of our Spiritual Governours, is ſo generally laid aſide, that many that would, yet dare not preſs it upon the people; and that, even they that obey do it ſecretly, and, as, though 'twere diſhonourable, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aſhamed to own it; Hence comes that great neglect of Confirmation, that moſt neceſſary and ancient, if not Apoſtolick conſtitution; hence the deſuetude of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon appointed days, and even of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them: and the non-obſervance of Holy days, and times of ſolemn devotion;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103707:103"/> hence the ſlight regard had to the publick worſhip of God, and the ſeldom receiving of the Lords Supper; hence the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs and unhappy ſecrecy or moſt people in not acquainting their ſpiritual guides with the ſtate of their conſcience when it needs, and not receiving their comforts and directions; hence the not ſending for the Elders of the Church to do their office upon ſick perſons, and the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſiring their abſolution; and hence even in too many of the Clergy, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of daily ſaying Divine Offices, as they are commanded, and obſerving other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions peculiar to them. I may ſay that it fares with our Church as with ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who have their due ſovereignty denied them becauſe they are Chriſtians: (as if by becoming members and defenders of the Church, they were become ſubject to Pontifical Chairs and Puritan Synods) for ſo, many would not have this Church obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe 'tis Reformed; they would not have its laws obſerved, becauſe it makes them inferior to Gods; as though, by not impoſing a blind ſuperſtitious and over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere obedience, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth, this Church were become uncapable of exerciſing any authority over her children and requiring any duty from them. But I ſay, let thoſe that love <hi>JESUS</hi> amend this, for his ſake: for the Church is his ſpouſe and hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103707:103"/> received her power from him; let them yield a free and religious obedience to Eccleſiaſtical injunctions, for his ſake who hath ſaid, <hi>he that receiveth you receiveth me.</hi> It is doubtleſs our duty ſo to do: and I am ſure it will be a good token of a pious heart, when we ſhall obey them in the Lord, whom the Lord hath ſet over us. We ſhall make it appear that we own the Authority of our heavenly King, when we are ſubject to thoſe his officers, by whom he now reigns over us: to whom he hath given the keys of his kingdom, and whom he hath appointed Stewards of his ſaving Myſteries: we ſhall have a right, and a ſhare in the Myſterious repreſentation of of the great expiatory ſacrifice, which by the Church is celebrated in the Euchariſt, and in thoſe Divine Services and ſolemn Prayers which the Church offers to God daily: and we ſhall receive the full benefit of being members of the Church and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with it. If this were not abſolutely required, yet I am ſure it will be a very acceptable free-will offering, if we do it devoutly and joyfully, becauſe we love <hi>JESUS;</hi> and this Chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the known, rational, and pious orders of the Church, will anſwer the beſt part of that ancient and ſo much magnified ſelf-abnegation, vowed by the Coenobites, when they gave up themſelves to be in all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103707:104"/> things ruled and commanded by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors: and it will exerciſe thoſe two heavenly graces, meekneſs and humility, which the world deſpiſeth, but all true Chriſtians own to be moſt Divine: as they that bring <hi>reſt to the ſoul,</hi> Mat. 11.29. and make us moſt conformable to the meek and humble <hi>JESUS.</hi> Solomon <hi>knew the true mother by her love to the child: and the true child of God, may be known by his love and duty to his Mother the Church.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of ſeveral voluntary Oblations.</head>
                     <p>AS for corporal auſterities command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or uncommanded, I have ſaid ſomething of them already: and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſe and deſign of them is to mortifie ſenſual luſts, and to keep under the body that the ſpirit may rule and be obeyed; yet, as they are exerciſes of repentance, marks of the juſt indignation we conceive againſt our ſelves for having diſpleaſed God; as they may effect or expreſs a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh of temporal pleaſures, a longing for heavenly joys, and an endeavour to take up our croſs and follow <hi>JESUS;</hi> they may
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103707:104"/> be the matter of a free-will offering, and they may find a gracious reward and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance inſomuch as they proceed from a ſincere love to <hi>JESUS.</hi> Prayer alſo, thankſgiving, reading, meditation, acts of Religion; though, as to the ſubſtance, they be the diſcharge of the greateſt duty God requires of us, the worſhip and adoration of his Divine Majeſty: yet as to the quantity, they may become free oblations, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a greater love. He that with devout affections enlargeth his offices, or counts the frequency of them by Canonical hours and wiſht for opportunities: and he that ſets apart large portions for religious exerciſes, or in the following of his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary buſineſs, doth often lift up his heart and thoughts to heaven and heavenly things, makes a voluntary offering of ſome of his time, to him of whoſe eternity he hopes to be partaker. He that defalks ſome hours from the refreſhment of his body, to beſtow them upon his ſoul; he that chuſeth a meaner condition and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that having fewer avocations he may ſpend more time upon Religion; and he that bears with ſome wrongs and injuries, that being free from the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of quarrels and law ſuits, he may be the better diſpoſed to ſerve God, hath bought the bleſſed opportunity of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>JESUS</hi> and indearing himſelf to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103707:105"/> him. Charity likewiſe, whether Spiritual or Corporal, whether in giving or in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving may be carried further than is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely required, and ſo become a free ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. He that takes great pains to inſtruct the ignorant, to convert ſinners, by all means to win ſouls to <hi>JESUS,</hi> may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a greater love than was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his own ſalvation; and he that makes it his buſineſs and delight to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent quarrels or make reconciliations; to comfort and defend the afflicted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to viſit hoſpitals and relieve the poor; and to ſpend all his ſubſtance in pious uſes, for the honour of God, and Religion, and for the preſent and future happineſs of men, may exceed what God would have rewarded, and by ſhewing ſo great a love enrich his crown of glory and recompence. I only mark the head-ſprings or ſtore-houſes of thoſe arbitrary gifts wherewith men may honour God and enrich themſelves: the ſeveral emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and offerings which may proceed from them, being free and innumerable, cannot be ſpecified, and ſhould not be impoſed. Where there is love there is a willing mind: and 2 Cor. 8.12. <hi>where there is a willing mind a man</hi> (in other caſes as well as in charity) <hi>is accepted, according to what he hath, and not according to what

Some ſow that by the expected crop they may increaſe their wealth; (which repreſents the good works of more innocent perſons, who aſpire to a great reward and a glorious crown.) Some ſow that they may have ſomething wherewith to expreſs their gratitude, and make preſents to their kind land-lord or benefactor; (whereby is ſignified the beſt of Chriſtians, who in all things ſeek and deſign the glory of their Lord.)

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The true notion of Free-will Offerings vindicated, with an Exhortation to abound in the work of the Lord.</head>
                     <p>HEre it may be proper, to inſert the caution of an ancient Rule. Be ſure <q>thou firſt obſerve that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">Cupiens divinum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implere conſilium, ante omnia ſerva mandatum. <hi>Athan.</hi>
                           </note> before thou doſt aim at Counſels.</q> Neglect not a duty becauſe thou doſt <hi>offer freely,</hi> and art over-zealous in other things. Thus the covetous worldling gripes and niggardly detains, becauſe he deſigns to build alms-houſes at laſt: and thus the factious zealot breaks the ſecond, with the firſt Table of the Divine Law; making Religion an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for his uncharitableneſs and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103707:106"/> But if we love <hi>JESUS</hi> with hearty affection, we ſhall be far enough from thus mocking God, and deceiving our ſelves; for love that doubles upon us all obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of duty, doth alſo oblige us to theſe free-will offerings. They are not amends for our omiſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or exchanges in lieu of our obedience: but they are the fulfilling of that law of Gratitude we now live under. The infinite mercies of the Goſpel, put upon us infinite obligations to do in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, for God, all that poſſibly we are able. But the Goſpel is a Law of liberty, all its extent and meaſures are not in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, minutely and expreſly defined.</p>
                     <p>So then by theſe free-will offerings, we muſt not underſtand any thing like ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogations; or things to which we are no ways obliged: or that exceed what God hath done for us, or what he will reward: or that are done without his help, <hi>without whom we can do nothing;</hi> any of theſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is impious, and implies a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But by them is to be underſtood, the expreſſion of our acknowledgments, and of that love we owe infinitely, in things not expreſly commanded, and not under neceſſity. <hi>Of ſuch</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I ſpeak not by commandment, but by occaſion, and to prove the ſincerity of your love,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.8. They that like the <hi>Macedonians have firſt given themſelves to the Lord,</hi> may well
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103707:107"/> with them be willing to offer to God, to their power, and beyond their power. To this purpoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that his preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together his duty, and wo unto him if he fulfilled it not: but his doing it willingly for nothing, in the Regions of <hi>Achaia;</hi> for that <hi>he had a reward,</hi> and that was <hi>his boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>his glorying,</hi> of which no man ſhould rob him. To this purpoſe alſo, the ancient Fathers have ſaid many things. That ſome good works we do <hi>verius virtutis amore, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beraque electione, quam ulla omnino legis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actione,</hi> rather by a free choice and love, than by precept. That thus to do things for God beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commandments was highly acceptable and highly rewarded.<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

Chryſ.</note> That to abſtain from that which is evil,<note place="margin">In licitis cavere jugum neceſſitatis eſt, permiſſa vincere munus arbitrii.</note> is abſolutely required: and farther to deny our ſelves for Religions ſake, is a free ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And much more to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is frequently to be met with, in thoſe true and devout lovers of the Bleſſed <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi> whoſe affection and gratitude to him, nothing could fully expreſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine.</p>
                     <p>And now by theſe, and firſt by holy
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103707:107"/> Scripture, it manifeſtly appears, that the true notion of Free-will offerings, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing favours humane pride, or derogates from Gods Glory. Can the Beggar merit or preſume anythng, if he throws away the dirt in his hand, for to receive Gold? and if with <hi>David,</hi> we pour out to God, that water we thirſted and might lawfully have drunk, that we may more largely drink the water of life, which God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives us, ſhall we therefore exalt our ſelves?</p>
                     <p>Let us then endeavour, by all means to make it appear that we are ſenſible how infinitely we are obliged to love and ſerve <hi>JESUS. Let us not,</hi> as the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> adviſeth, <hi>conſult with a coward in matters of war;</hi> conſult with an irreligious age, in matters of Piety and Religion: and let us not think it enough to do as the moſt do. When firſt the Chriſtian Faith was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, and men underſtood what Chriſt had done for them, and what he had promiſed, they thought nothing too much, nor too good for him. They cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully parted with temporal pleaſures, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and riches; with their liberties, their limbs, their bloud, their very lives, that they might be faithful to <hi>JESUS,</hi> and come to reign with him. They made it appear by their patient, cheerful, and magnanimous ſufferings, that they valued
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103707:108"/> nothing but <hi>JESUS</hi> and Eternity. We are not now expoſed to the ſame dangers for the profeſſion and belief of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but we may make our love and zeal appear, by our contempt of the world and aſpiring after heaven; by our charity to men, and abounding in the work of the Lord; by keeping the Commandments, as well as dying for the Creed; the ſame Lord and Saviour that requires our Faith to the one, demands our obedience to the other. And now, if we ſpend our time in the hearty obſervance of our Lords Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and intimations, in doing and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our duty to the utmoſt of our power; if we thus <hi>confeſs him before men</hi> by living to him: then are we prepared to die for him, and he will certainly own us as much as if we had. Our Crown now this way, may be enriched, and our love ſhewn and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as well as by the flames of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And O happy we! that we can come, and more happy yet if we do come, to ſing Allelujah, and eternally praiſe our gracious Redeemer with the noble Army of Martyrs; where the love we had here ſhall fill our hearts with divine joy,<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi tota virtus erit, O anima videre quod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, &amp; ſumma felicitas amare quod vedes. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <p>I need not here inſert cautions againſt vain glory and ſelf complacency after we have done the moſt we are able: for if it proceeds not from the love of God, it is nothing worth; and if it doth, it will never bring pride nor vanity. <hi>Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, and is not puffed up,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4.

We can never do too much for <hi>JESUS:</hi> but we may eaſily do too little; though the

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103707:110"/> to work our Redemption, our love and gratitude might have been exceſſive, and provoked God to jealouſie. But now Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>JESU,</hi> we cannot humble our ſelves too low before thee; we cannot exalt thee too high; we can never exceed in paying our acknowledgments to thee. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing. Unto him</hi> therefore <hi>that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood; and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father: to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Rev. 5.12. and 1.6.</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed Lord, I rejoice that thou haſt the diſpoſal of me; I willingly ſubmit my ſelf to thy good pleaſure, both to obey and to ſuffer; I deſire that my heart and all my affections may wholly be ſubject to thee.</p>
                     <p>O why is thy name diſhonoured? thy Church perſecuted? thy holy Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, or perverted? and thou thy ſelf rejected and rebelled againſt, even by many of them that have ſworn allegiance to thee?</p>
                     <p>O that it were in my power to advance thy Kingdom here, among my Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; to bring all men in ſubjection to thee. But firſt, my Bleſſed Lord, let me ſincerely ſubmit to thy will, in all things. Let never one of my words or actions ſend
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103707:111"/> thee that impious meſſage of the rebellious Citizens; <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.14. but now thou art ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I beſeech thee, let me obſerve thy laws and own and reverence thy power, in them to whom thou haſt imparted it; thy Church and Miniſters. Thou art my King, deareſt <hi>JESU,</hi> let me never ſee that hour, that I ſhall not heartily love, and humbly obey thee.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, O my Soul, how great is the happineſs and honour, to be one of the retinue of ſo great, ſo good a Maſter. Let nothing caſt thee down; thou ſhalt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reign above, if thou art faithful here below.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſons were in fear to periſh with hunger, becauſe they knew not that <hi>Joſeph</hi> did reign in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> but my timorous heart, why ſhouldſt thou fear any thing, when thou knoweſt that <hi>JESUS</hi> doth reign in heaven? God <hi>hath given him power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life,</hi> to all that will ſincerely give themſelves to him. If thou art his, thou canſt not want to be protected, and provided for. All his ſervants are certainly prefer'd; all his ſouldiers come to be Kings; the Crown of life, the Kingdom of heaven, the glories of eternity, are the recompences laid up for his humble ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>Live and Reign, ſweeteſt <hi>JESU,</hi> for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103707:111"/> ever. When I do conſider that Legions of Angels, millions of bleſſed Souls, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually adore thee with the greateſt extaſie of love and divine joy; that all pious men throughout all the world, expreſs their love and gratitude, by daily worſhipping and obeying of thee; that all thy wicked enemies are ſeiz'd with fear and trembling before thee. When thus I ſee thee, bleſſed Lord, with the eyes of my faith, on the Throne of higheſt Majeſty, encircled with glory and power: I then diſdain the world, and am raiſed above my ſelf, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with pleaſure, to ſee thy labours and ſufferings thus juſtly rewarded; to think that <hi>mine</hi> for thee, ſhall have the ſame reward, according to the utmoſt of my capacity.</p>
                     <p>And now my gracious Lord, this I make my requeſt; if I can add nothing to thy higheſt glory: yet let me enter in, and partake of thy joy; for <hi>they that love thy name ſhall be joyful in thee,</hi> Pſal. 5.12.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Two general directions about the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of our love to God.</head>
                     <p>IT is a Maxim in Morals, <hi>quod cor non facit, non fit,</hi> what the heart doth not, is reputed as not done; it can deſerve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praiſe nor reward; and it can ſignifie nothing to any purpoſe of vertue. Now the heart is the fountain of humane affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the ſeat of love: ſo that the meaning is, that what is not done out of love, is inſignificant and wholly unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Which truth holds in Religion alſo; God earneſtly requires the heart of all his worſhippers, and without it, he doth accept neither their ſervices, nor their oblations. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul; and theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart,</hi> Deut. 6.6.</p>
                     <p>Love therefore muſt carry us through the whole courſe of our lives, through all our duty; that our actions bearing its ſtamp, and ſignature, may be pleaſing to God, and to us profitable. So that in the diſcharge of our ſeveral callings; in our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103707:112"/> intercourſe with others, at home or abroad; and in the moſt common actions of our lives, ſtill we muſt act, as being acted by a ſincere love to God. It is one of the beſt of thoſe ancient Rules which were given to aſcetick perſons; <q>Let charity which abides for ever,<note place="margin">In omnibus quibus utitur tranſitura neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, ſuperemineat quae permanet charitas. <hi>Reg. Aug.</hi>
                           </note> influence and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the uſe we make of time, and other tranſitory things;</q> let it go along with us in all our ways, and we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly go right. But this, like other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, will ſignifie nothing, except it be applied to particulars. My love to <hi>JESUS</hi> muſt appear in what I do this day, and what I ſhall do to morrow. The juſtice and charity of the words I ſpeak, and the work I am about, muſt juſtifie it, that indeed I own <hi>JESUS</hi> for my Lord, his Goſpel for my Rule; and his love, for my comfort and encouragements. <hi>Let cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which abides for ever, direct us in our uſe of tranſitory things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the advice of ſome ſpiritual dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that we would ſingle out ſome one eminent Chriſtian vertue, to the ſtudy whereof we ſhould more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves, and examine our growth in grace, by our proficiency in it. This may be much for our eaſe and for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103707:113"/> For the Duties and Graces of our Religion are very numerous, not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and attended to, all at once, and as they ſtand together: whereas if we make choice of any one ſingle, which leads us to all the reſt, and includes them all, our Chriſtian advancement will be with greater ſpeed and leſs difficulty, and we ſhall be maſters of all other vertues, by having bent our ſtrength and endeavours on the practice of one. Such a one, I am ſure, is the love of God, the love of the Bleſſed <hi>JESUS,</hi> which if well followed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, will bring us to the higheſt perfection, to which any Chriſtian can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in this life. Let it therefore be our chiefeſt care to beget and entertain in our hearts that moſt bleſſed love; and then, to expreſs and perfect it, by theſe two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In all our actions to have reſpect to Gods will, and to ſeek to fulfil it, rather than our own. This is recommended to us by the Example of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who profeſſed that <hi>he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him:</hi> and this was his great <hi>demonſtration</hi> of love to the Father. <hi>That the world may know that I love the Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Probatio dilectionis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio eſt operis. <hi>Greg.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>and as the Father gave me Commandment even ſo I do: ariſe, let us
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103707:113"/> go hence,</hi> Joh. 14.31. He would go and deliver himſelf into the hands of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, rather than not comply with that order he had received from God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And thus if we chuſe Gods will where it is moſt contradictory to our own deſires, we ſhall make it appear that indeed we love him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the Friend of God; and God bare him witneſs that he indeed feared God, when in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the divine commandment he would have ſacrificed his beloved <hi>Iſaak:</hi> and if we ſacrifice our will to God, to act in all things according to what he hath revealed; to ſquare our actions, great or ſmall, according to the Rules he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us, then God will be certified that we indeed love him; our readineſs to obey his pleaſure, will ſpeak the hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our affection.</p>
                     <p>We ſee how readily Courtiers conform themſelves to the humour and pleaſure of their Prince: and ſhall we think it hard to conform to what God hath required of us: our obedience being our greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit here, and our infinite happineſs in the world to come? Sure 'tis no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſay with that great lover of <hi>JESUS; Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9.6. and if love hath diſpoſed us to ſay it, 'twill be eaſie enough to do it afterwards.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, as we muſt ſet our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103707:114"/> hand to that prayer we ought to ſay daily; <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,</hi> ſo muſt we alſo ſubmit our necks to it. I mean, that in compliance to the will of God, we muſt give up our ſelves, as well to patient ſufferance, as to cheerful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>One of the great advantages the Coeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites had in their communities, was the caſting out thoſe two words, which are the ſeeds of contention and the diſturbers of the world, <hi>mine,</hi> and <hi>thine:</hi> and if we reſign all, to God, who is indeed the true proprietor, we ſhall bear the loſs of any thing, without repining againſt him; we ſhall never differ with him, about that which is not our own; we ſhall have peace with him, whatever we ſuffer. <hi>God is the judge, he ſetteth up one, and bringeth down another.</hi> All things that happen are ordered by his infinite power and wiſdom; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all, let us rejoice in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with a cheerful ſubmiſſion hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bow and worſhip, and ſay with his Saints; <hi>Allelujah, for the Lord God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent reigneth; let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him,</hi> Rev. 19.6.</p>
                     <p>If we truly love God, we ſhall as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffer any thing from him, as we would for him, perſwaded that it is for our good, we ſhall not only remain ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but thankful alſo. I am ſure, 'tis
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103707:114"/> much more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gods will,<note place="margin">Aequius eſt ut nos ejus, quam ut ille no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram ſequatur volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> than he ours. And ſome have ſaid, that it is better and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God,<note place="margin">Perfectius eſt adverſa tolerare patienter, quam bonis operibus inſudare.</note> to ſuffer afflictions pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, than in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do the beſt of things.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore in all our ſorrows, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves and look up to heaven, and ſay; <hi>Calicem quem dedit Pater; The Cup that my heavenly Father giveth me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> we ſhall always proſper, and have all things at wiſh, and command all events, <hi>as one did the winds and weather,</hi> In vit. Patr. if we by love adhere to God, and make his will our own, <hi>He that hath, and ſeeth all things in one, may always remain ſatisfied, and have true peace in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Magna res eſt amor; magnum omnino bonum, quod ſolum leve facit omne oneroſum, &amp; ſert aequaliter omne inaequale: nam onus ſine onere portat, &amp; omne amarum dalce ac ſapidum effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> Thom. de Kemp. The guilty priſoner dreads every noiſe, and trembles when the door opens, for fear of his deſerved doom; when on the ſame accounts, the innocent is both calm and joyful, expecting to be delivered. Now, guilt and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt treaſon before God, is to love any thing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103707:115"/> better than him, and to oppoſe our will to his, he that doth ſo, may well be diſmaid and troubled, and full of ſad apprehenſions: and he that ſincerely loves God and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his will in all things, is ſafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, always pleaſed and happy.</p>

                     <p>But commonly it is thought, that to make it appear that we love God, we muſt do great and extraordinary things, fly up above other mens pitch, and always be as it were gazing and ſighing heaven-ward. This hath frighted many from a religious life, from devoting themſelves to the love of <hi>JESUS:</hi> But the truth is, that love is beſt expreſt by doing well our ordinary actions, that which is our proper duty and employment.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103707:115"/>
                     <p>Our greateſt perfection here, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe two. 1. To do what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and 2. to do it well. The firſt is to diſcharge the duties of that ſtation wherein God hath placed us; <hi>That every man wherein he is called, therein he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with God, and do his own buſineſs.</hi> This is our task as we are men, and as we are Chriſtians. Not to do things wonderful and inimitable: but faithfully to diſcharge what our place requires from us, to pay to all, that love and obedience, which nature and Religion appoint; to follow our work, whatever it be, even the moſt ſervile la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>as to the Lord and not to men: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whatever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi>

                        </note> is much better, than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take greater things, which we were not obliged to. The firſt frees us from, and the other doth ingage us into temptation. <hi>The commandment I gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103707:116"/> thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off, it is not in in heaven, neither is it beyond the ſea: but the word is very nigh thee, in thy month and in thy heart, that thou maiſt do it,</hi> Deut. 30.11. It maketh ſome Quakers, ſome fantaſtical, and ſome mad, the ſeeking to profeſs and to do ſtrange things, things out of the road. And even in the beſt of all religious inſtitutes, there is nothing good, except it be this, that they are particular applications of the general Goſpel-Rules; which particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to times, perſons, and places, are beſt made by the deſignation of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which to every man appoints that ſphere, wherein he is bound to move re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly. Let us therefore humbly acquieſce to Gods wiſe diſpoſal, making that to be our ſtudy and work, which our ſtate and condition doth require from us: and let our next care be, in the ſecond place to be intent upon that, and to do it well.</p>
                     <p>In what appears before the world, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men put a varniſh upon their actions and their behaviour; when oftentimes at home they are looſe tyranical, and unjuſt. But act in private and every where, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſub alicujus boni viri, ac ſemper praeſentis oculis, ſaid</hi> Seneca; as always in the ſight of God; in the moſt publick view. For your actions at home, in your cloſet and in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103707:116"/> your family are noted and regiſtred before God: and 'tis by the doing them well, that you advance forward, towards perfection and glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hoc age, hoc age,</hi> was often cryed by a herald whilſt the heathen worſhipped their Gods. <hi>Mind your buſineſs, mind that you are about.</hi> That we muſt do in all actions, even them that relate only to this life, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and faithfully to do them as well as we can. The praiſe of an actor on the ſtage of this world, is to act his part well and decently, whatever it be; and that muſt be our care, to be juſt and exact, in being a good ſervant or maſter; artiſt, or whatever it be. In ſo being conſiſts our perfection, and the demonſtration of our love to God.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe in things that pertain to a better life; when you pray, read or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, do it with a ſerious attention, and the greateſt application your mind is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Do it as if you were now to die, and that were the laſt thing you ſhall ever do for God, and for your own ſoul; for if you be in haſte, in a hurry, and in a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you wholly loſe your time and your reward.</p>
                     <p>It is ſtoried in ſome of the legends, that at prayers, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaw divers Angels, noting down the behaviour of the aſſiſtants; ſome in golden letters, ſome in ink, and ſome
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103707:117"/> in water only, according to the devotion or negligence of them that prayed. Though the relation looks much like a fable, yet there is this truth in it; that they certainly weary themſelves to no purpoſe who ſerve God without attention and without fervour: and do the buſineſs of their ſoul in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and trifling way.</p>
                     <p>As Mathematicians conſider an abſtract quantity, not regarding whether of Gold or clay: ſo it is not ſo much the matter of our actions, as the manner of doing them, that moſt recommends them to God, and makes them expreſſions of our love to <hi>JESUS.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond Rule of bearing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently what ever happens. It muſt be alſo extended to the meaneſt ſorrows and vexations.</p>
                     <p>In all things let us be content that Gods will ſhould take place. Let us carefully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our duty, and afterwards let us care for no more; leave the event to God, and let him chuſe for us.</p>
                     <p>It is to no purpoſe to reſolve to bear evenly great calamities, which perhaps ſhall never happen; to gather a ſtock of patience againſt violent perſecutions and the flames of martyrdom: and mean while to be fretful and angry, for every loſs and trifling accident that croſſeth our humour. This is but ſelf deceit, and an imaginary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103707:117"/> patience, ſtoutly to reſolve upon great evils when they are far off, and yield to leſſer when preſent. We are rather to remember the words of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>to take up our croſs daily and follow him.</hi> The word <hi>daily</hi> imports, that the evils of every day are to be born with patience and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind. And that the wrongs and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations we meet withall in our intercourſe with others, as well as great calamitie, are our own proper croſs, which our Chriſtian profeſſion, and love to <hi>JESUS,</hi> obligeth us to bear and ſubmit to.</p>

Let us follow the Prince of ſufferings by love and imitation, cheerfully bearing our croſs, whatever it be; mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this profitable advice of the ſon of <hi>Sirach. My ſon, if thou come to ſerve the Lord, prepare thy ſoul for temptation; ſet thy heart aright and conſtantly endure, and make
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103707:118"/> not haſte in time of trouble. Whatſoever is brought unto thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low eſtate They that fear the Lord will not diſobey his word, and they that love him, will keep his ways.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> That upon all accounts, God ſhould be loved above all things.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt Conſideration is, that it is moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable to love any creature to the prejudice of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. As all things hare their being from God, ſo they have from him all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and beauty which makes them lovely to us, and God drawing upon viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fair copies of his inviſible perfections,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103707:120"/> deſigned to be loved in them: or that they ſhould be loved in him, and for his ſake. <hi>If men being delighted with the beauty of the heavenly hoſt took them to be gods, let them know how much better the Lord of them is, for the firſt Author of beauty hath created them: for by the beauty and greatneſs of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is ſeen,</hi> Wiſd. 13.3. Beauty and goodneſs are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of love: and therefore, God who is the firſt and ſupreme beauty and goodneſs, ſhould be loved before all things.</p>
                     <p>We indeed reverence Princes in their ſeals and arms, in their meaneſt ſervants clothed with their livery: but ſhould a ſubject ſet up theſe in the royal Throne, and transfer to them, or even to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Favorite, thoſe ſpecial honours which belong to the Prince only; he ſhould juſtly be deemed a Rebel, and his proceedings would be as unjuſtifiable, as the diſloyal diſtinction of <hi>taking arms by the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt his Perſon.</hi> Yet ſuch are the proceedings of all diſorderly lovers, I mean of all ſinners: who ſetting more of their affections upon the creatures, than upon God the Creator, pay them afterwards a greater veneration than they do to him; having exalted honours, pleaſures and riches into the Imperial chair, they do more for them than for the Sovereign
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103707:121"/> himſelf: nay they obey them to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and againſt his expreſs command. Thus vicious unreaſonable men burn in the ſhade, and freeze where the Sun ſhines; they dote upon inferior beauties, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the higheſt and moſt perfect; they take fire at dark ſhadows, and find no heat in the brighteſt light. Great men have a reſpect paid them, in their degenerating poſterity: great Artiſts are reſpected in their liveleſs children; we highly honour unhappy Pagans in thoſe labours of theirs which adorn our cloſets and libraries: God only is diſhonoured in his works, the more perfect he hath made them, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious they prove to him. <hi>Phidias</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi> are remembred with veneration, in a fine picture or Statue: God only is ingratefully forgotten in a lovely creature whereof he is Maker.

                     <p>God hath done like a loving father, who jealous of his ſons affection, would have none to attend him but ſuch as wear his livery; would have the picture of himſelf hang in every room; and all the goods in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103707:121"/> the houſe marked with his name and cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: So God, who loves men tenderly, and deſires to be by them loved again, hath put ſomething of himſelf in all the creatures he hath appointed to ſerve us; that, which way ſoever we turn our eyes, we might be put in mind of him, he hath ſtamped his name in more or leſs legible Characters, upon all the goods and utenſils of this his great houſe, the world, wherein he hath placed us. And now ſhall we do like a ſimple child, who turning his back upon his father, ſhould look and ſmile on his picture, and careſs it, and wait upon it, and ask it bleſſing, while he ſlights the original? So abſurd a thing would be counted madneſs, and move pity or laughter: but when we act the ſame folly, in loving the world while we deſpiſe God, we are highly criminal, and we highly provoke our heavenly Father, thus to return to him contempt and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the gracious tokens of his love.</p>
                     <p>From hence it follows, that, as we ſhould love God above all, and all things, things in him and for him; we ſhould alſo love thoſe things moſt, which have moſt of his impreſs and likeneſs. Therefore, man who is created after Gods image, ſhould be by us loved above all other creatures: and that part of man which is chiefly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the likeneſs of God, ſhould have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103707:122"/> the greater ſhare of our affection. God himſelf values humane ſouls at a high rate, becauſe they are like him; as appears by what he hath done and ſuffered to ſave them. And for the ſame reaſon alſo, we ſhould pay to the ſouls of men the beſt part of that kindneſs we owe them: and if we do not, we give our friends no greater love than children do their puppets; for they dreſs them fine, and lay them ſoft, and kiſs and embrace them: Juſt as they who aim at nothing more, than to make their friends merry, to wiſh them toys and gaudy things and to ſee them at eaſe. A fondneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable in rational creatures, eſpecially in Chriſtians, who know the worth of an immortal ſoul and the great concern of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: and yet ſeek only to gratifie the material part of their friends which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption, and to ingage their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the world which paſſeth away and they muſt ſoon leave. As if when King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt was haſtening out of the Holy-land hither to receive the Crown which expected him, his friends had ſtaid him by the way, and invited him to reſt and eaſe, and provided for him all Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, and entertainments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded his coming ſo long, till he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or loſt his right and his Kingdom. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole word and loſe his ſoul? and what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi>

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:103707:122"/>
                     <p>We are indeed much commanded <hi>to love one another,</hi> and in this conſiſteth one great half of our Religion, all juſtice and charity, and all the duties of the ſecond Table. To love our brother as we ought, is the beſt demonſtration of our love to God, for <hi>he that ſays he loves God, and hateth his brother, is a liar,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. and <hi>love worketh no ill to his neighbour, and is therefore the fulfilling of the law,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13.10. but a man is to <hi>love his neighbour as himſelf,</hi> Mat. 19.19. and therefore as he is moſt obliged to ſeek for himſelf <hi>the kingdom of God and its righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> ſo ſhould he in the firſt place endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure it to his friend. Or elſe we are <hi>to love one another as Chriſt hath loved us,</hi> Joh. 13.33. and that was in redeeming our ſouls and purchaſing for us heavenly joys and eternal life: not in providing eaſe and ſenſual pleaſures to our bodies here in this world. The reſult of this is, that in the firſt place we ſhould love God infinitely and for his own ſake: and that in the next, we ſhould love thoſe things moſt which have a neareſt relation to God; Grace and Vertue, Religion, Holineſs and Men; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Souls, which are an image of the Deity; eſpecially ſanctified ſouls which are moſt like God.

                     <p>A Second conſideration may be, that it is moſt juſt and eaſie to love God. That it is moſt juſt, is ſhewn all along this diſcourſe, wherein I have repreſented the more general and moſt excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God to mankind: all the which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge and deſerve the greateſt love our hearts are capable of. God had required of his people that the firſt born and the firſt fruits ſhould be conſecrated to him, thereby to acknowledge him the author of all their bleſſings and the giver of all their increaſe: Now the firſt-born of our ſouls, the firſt-fruits of our hearts is love, which God, who gives us all things, demands as an acknowledgment from us, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103707:123"/> with all thy ſoul.</hi> We therefore commit a greater ſacriledge, if we deny him ſo juſt a tribute, than if a Jew had rob'd him of his firſt grapes or his firſt ears of corn. But it is ſo much the more juſt, in that it is moſt eaſie to love God. Infinite perfections, an abyſs of goodneſs whence rivers and oceans of good things do perpetually flow, one would think ſhould ſwallow up the hearts and affections of men: as indeed it doth, of all that duly conſider it. And more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of beatified Saints, and of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits who miniſter before his throne and are all flame for him. Beſides, 'tis natural for men to love what is theirs, propriety begets or increaſeth love: Now God is our God; he hath given himſelf for us, he doth now, and will more intirely hereafter give himſelf to us; he made us for the enjoyment of himſelf, and for that purpoſe he hath redeemed us: and that we might all ſay, with <hi>David, O God, thou art my God,</hi> that God might ſhew his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indear himſelf to us, and aſſert our right to him, he hath aſſumed the names of thoſe relations who love us beſt, whom we love moſt tenderly, and whom we count moſt ours. God the Father is pleaſed to be called our Father, God the Son, our Brother, and God the Holy Ghoſt our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as it were our Friend: thereby to expreſs that affection which he hath for us,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103707:124"/> and the propriety which we may claim in him. Sure 'tis an eaſie thing to love them that love us:<note place="margin">Nimis durus eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, qui amorem etſi u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NOW here I will digreſs a little to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer two Objections which poſſibly might be made againſt what I have ſaid of Divine Love. The firſt, that I have huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized it too much; that whereas it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and ſhould be ſpiritual, I have made it almoſt palpable and ſenſible. To this I ſay, that whether we ſet our love upon earthly or heavenly things, upon God or upon the world, ſtill it is the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which reſides in the ſame humane faculty. The will of man, and the effects thereof are alike evident and real. He that truly loves God, hath that ſame hearty affection for him, as to the kind, as one friend hath for another: only being joined with greater reverence and ſubmiſſion to ſo glorious a Majeſty, it is called <hi>Religious</hi> and devout. But a ſincere lover of <hi>JESUS</hi> will ſeek to pleaſe him, and to be with him, and to enjoy him, and do all that for him, which men would do for thoſe whom they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103707:125"/> love heartily: all the difference is, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love hath its proper expreſſions, can never be too great, and is in all reſpects infinitely more excellent than the love of any creature. Therefore, if in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have repreſented things plainly, and made that, in ſome manner to be touched by ſenſe which is only the object of faith, my deſign was thereby to move the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to bring down the notions of Religion, from the head into the heart. <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. We ſhould conſider things of faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſt or to come, as if they had now a real ſubſiſtence, as if they were preſent before our eyes; their greatneſs then, would be better viewed, and have the greater power upon us: as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who, by conſideration, <hi>ſeeing him who is inviſible,</hi> ver. 27. was thereby enabled to prefer the afflictions of Gods people to the pleaſures and dignities of the Courts of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> I believe it was a great advantage to the Piety of Primitive ages, that they lived near the time when thoſe things were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which we now believe at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: for then the Revelations of the New Teſtament were every Chriſtians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and admiration; the proximity of the times made them almoſt viſible, and the recent footſteps of thoſe great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103707:126"/> gave them a kind of ſenſibility, whereby their thoughts and conſiderations were drawn and retained, and made ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and efficacious. And I believe it may be a great cauſe of the degeneracy of theſe after ages, that faith is become too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, too metaphyſical and abſtracted, a matter of diſpute and ſcience, rather than of practice and conſcience: whereas we ſhould veſt the great objects of our faith with material circumſtances, to make them in ſome manner the object of ſenſe, that to us it might be ſaid as S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Before your eyes JESUS CHRIST hath been evidenly ſet forth, crucified among you,</hi> Gal. 3.1. and that, in all other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, our faith might be to us, <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> When we look upon the things of revelation as far diſtant from us, they appear hardly credible, and not much to be regarded: but a cloſer viewing of them, by a nearer and almoſt ſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration would make them appear great and wonderful, would make deep and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſions on our minds, and cauſe us to cry out with grief and wonder; Lord, what is man, that thou art thus mindful of him! or rather, what is man, that he is unmindful of thee! However, I have the warrant, and do claim the priviledge of them that write meditations, and make contemplations palpable and to be ſeen:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103707:126"/> to ſuppoſe dialogues, to deſcribe what was paſt long ago, as now in doing, and to repreſent things as preſent and viſible; and well we may, eſpecially when we treat of the love of God ſhewed to mankind in <hi>JESUS:</hi> for that love became palpable, and converſt among men, and was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to ſenſe, in the birth, the actions, and the ſufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour: who by becoming man, ſeemed to comply with that unjuſt and yet general deſire which men had, of worſhipping humane creatures, and having things viſible and material for the object of their devotion and Religious love.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The ſecond Objection concerning the love of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, anſwered.</head>
                     <p>THE other Objection would perhaps be made by them who ſcruple and refuſe to bow at the Holy name of <hi>JESUS,</hi> and who might ſay that I have mentioned it too often, and too often called divine charity, The love of <hi>JESUS:</hi> and that in ſo doing I have been either ſuperſtitious or injurious to God. To this I anſwer, That as our Bleſſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103707:127"/> Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that hateth me, hateth my father alſo,</hi> Joh. 15.23. ſo we may ſay, that he that loveth him loveth his father alſo. For the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt are one and the ſame God bleſſed for ever; <hi>he that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten,</hi> and ſo reciprocally. The Divine Eſſence is but one, it admits of no diviſion: therefore whatever honour is paid to one of the Divine Perſons, is paid to all Three; the Ever-glorious Trinity is honoured by it. But then it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that <hi>JESUS</hi> the ſecond Perſon of that Bleſſed and Glorious Trinity is not only God, but alſo Man, and ſo Mediator betwixt God and Man: ſo that by, and through him we pray, we worſhip, we love God. This is the great, the moſt excellent benefit of God to his Church, that he gave <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> his Bleſſed Son to be the head of it; who prays for us,<note place="margin">Qui orat pro nobis; orat in nobis; &amp; oratur à nobis.</note> and prays in us, and is prayed to by us; as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith. As God manifeſted his love to men in <hi>JESUS:</hi> ſo in <hi>JESUS</hi> men offer the returns of their love to God; <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. and in this is manifeſted our love towards God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103707:127"/> that we receive, and love, and obey that Son. With this, God is in no wiſe offended, but rather infinitely well pleaſed; <hi>he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my father;</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21 <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him,</hi> ver. 23. and again, <hi>If any man ſerve me, him will my father honour,</hi> Joh. 12.26. nay, he expreſly tells his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that the Father loved them, becauſe they loved him, whom the Father had ſent; <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me,</hi> John 16.27. For though we owe our redemption to the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: yet in a more eſpecial manner we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the Son, who perſonally came down from heaven, <hi>for us men and for our ſalvation. JESUS is the Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> he is the Founder of our Holy Religion; it is he hath revealed thoſe doctrines we are to believe; it is he hath given us thoſe laws and precepts whereby we are to live; it is he from whom we are called Chriſtians; it is he who for us <hi>deſpiſed the ſhame and endured the Croſs,</hi> who hath ſhed his blood and given his life a ranſom for ours; it is he who by contracting a near relation with us, becoming our brother, hath cauſed us to be adopted Sons of God, and heirs with him of an eternal kingdom;

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> That it is moſt pleaſant and ſafe to love God.</head>
                     <p>A Third conſideration will be, that it is moſt pleaſant and ſafe to love God. Love may cauſe trouble, but it certainly is the ſpring or parent of all joy and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He that hath an affection to nothing hath pleaſure in nothing: could the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary inſenſibleneſs of the Stoicks really ſeize upon any man: if he could never be miſerable, he would alſo be uncapable of all happineſs. 'Tis true indeed that the love of worldly things in that they are vain and periſhing, is it ſelf vanity and vexation: <hi>qui multum amat plus dolet,</hi> is certainly true of all but the Divine Love. He that hath many friends hath many ſorrows; he that loves many things hath many things to fear for: 'Tis only God that hath thoſe infinite excellencies which can fully repleniſh our minds and deſires: 'Tis only God that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning:</hi> and therefore 'tis the love of God alone that can make us eternally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely happy. It is reported of a perſon of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103707:130"/> great ſanctity, that an evil ſpirit confeſt to him, that were it poſſible for one who loves God to come into hell; yet were it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould be miſerable, but that it would rather ſink hell it ſelf and make it diſappear, or elſe make it a paradiſe for him. Though the relation may be fabulous, yet I believe the thing it ſelf is true: he that is joined to God by love, and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of him, who is the fountain of all joy, and bliſs, it is not poſſible he can be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; deſpair the hell of the damned can never ſeize his ſoul. However, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the love of God would ſweeten all the bitterneſs of our innocent miſeries, and that it is only the imperfection of a Chriſtians love that expoſeth his mind to the vexation of humane ſorrows. I am not (to my grief) a competent witneſs to this truth: but there have been many Saints and devout perſons who, in the fervency of their love to God, have found thoſe joys, thoſe raviſhments of joy which are ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Nihil crus ſentit in nervo, dum animus eſt in Coelo.</note> and which made them, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inſenſible and incapable of any great ſorrow. And even the leſſer love of more imperfect, though ſincere, Chriſtians, doth in a great meaſure take away the ſenſe of humane calamities, and brings to their minds the greateſt contentment and delight this world is capable of.</p>

Happy are they that can ſay with S. <hi>Paul, Our life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. and <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. The love of God fits us for the joys of heaven, and is an anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; it powerfullly governs the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103707:131"/> will, and it ſweetly overflows the mind; it is the perfection of grace, and will be the conſummation of glory: but 'tis much eaſier and happier to feel than to expreſs it. <hi>How much better is thy love than wine, and the ſmell of thine ointment than all ſpices!</hi> Cant. 4.10.</p>
                     <p>One thing that adds much to the worth and the pleaſure of Divine Love, is that it never fails: it is of the nature of its object, eternal, as God is; <hi>whether there be prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they ſhall fail: whether there be tongues, they ſhall ceaſe: whether there be knowledge, it ſhall vaniſh away: but charity never faileth.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. Faith and hope may accompany us as far as heaven-gate, but there they for ſake us; the one is turned into ſight and the other into enjoyment; love alone enters and abides with us to eternity. Our greateſt ſafety therefore as well as pleaſure conſiſts in loving God affectionately; for that love which <hi>never faileth</hi> ſecures our duty here and our happineſs hereafter. We are ſure never to live, and never to periſh in ſin, if we love <hi>JESUS</hi> ſincerely: <hi>He that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in love dwelleth in God:</hi> and there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin nor miſery can come to hurt him.</p>

If it cannot make him meek who is of an angry nature; it will make him angry againſt ſin, and againſt himſelf a ſinner: if it doth not make him bold and generous whoſe temper inclines him to timorouſneſs; it will turn his fear into prudence, and make him not dare to offend God: if it makes him not cheerful who naturally is melancholy; it will turn his ſadneſs into penitent ſorrow, and make him a <hi>bleſſed mourner.</hi> And ſo all other paſſions, love will make them inſtruments of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,<note place="margin">Amor ubi venerit, cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros in ſe traducit &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivat affectus.

                     <p>THE fourth and laſt conſideration is, that the love of God is the ſolid joy and laſting Tranquillity of the Soul. No tormenting fear or ſadneſs can harbour in a heart that loves God; the Motto of love might well be that of a late order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at <hi>Mantua,</hi> meant of the Holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, <hi>Nihil iſto triſte recepto;</hi> grief and the love of God are incompatible: no ſadneſs ſhould enter that breaſt wherein dwells Divine Love. I need not treat at large of thoſe many doubts and terrors concerning future happineſs which grieve and almoſt diſtract the hearts of many Chriſtians, to prove that it is a happy thing to be freed from them: there are few, but are ſo far acquainted with them as readily to aſſent to it; it will be more to purpoſe to ſhew that

To this evil none can preſcribe a better remedy than love: let ſuch perſons love God heartily, and all theſe terrors will vaniſh way like the vain images of a terrible dream; when one awaketh.

Let no man that loves God doubt of Gods Love to him: for he that loved us when we were his enemies, ſo as to die for us, will much more love us when we have for him the hearty affections of friends. It is the joy of heaven, the joy of the Holy <hi>JESUS</hi> when his loving kindneſs hath won and conquered our hearts, and 'tis our greateſt joy, 'tis for us a heaven upon earth, when we love him faithfully and fervently, with all our ſouls and affections.

                     <p>NOW who can refuſe to love God, when 'tis a thing ſo juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo pleaſant and eaſie, ſo ſafe and advantageous, ſomething of neceſſity we muſt love, every mans heart is full of that paſſion, and every mans life is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by it? 'tis but conſidering who hath done moſt for us, and whom we are moſt obliged to love; who is moſt lovely, and who will beſt reward our love: and we ſhall ſoon underſtand that God is to be loved above all things, infinitely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure: and if we love our ſelves as we ſhould, we ſhall eaſily remove our affections from the world to ſet them upon God and Eternity, upon <hi>JESUS</hi> and his Kingdom. Love, as we have ſeen, will make it eaſie and delightful to do our duty, will make the yoke of Chriſt light, and enable us with ſtrength and courage
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103707:138"/> to bear our croſs cheerfully like Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: it will lead us the ſhorteſt and the ſafeſt way to heaven, and make our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney pleaſant: it will make us dear to God, and to his Saints and bleſſed Angels, and fill our hearts with peace and comforts: it will abide with us, when we are forſaken by the world, and all our friends can do us no good: it will accompany us when we go from hence, and open heavens gate, and enter in with us; there to perfect our happineſs which it here began: to be there our reward, as it was here our work and our duty.</p>
